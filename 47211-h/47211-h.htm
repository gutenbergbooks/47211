<h2 class="pagebreak"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="subheading">COMETHUP ENTERS LIFE DISASTROUSLY.</p>


<p>&ldquo;My dear&rdquo; had looked her last upon a troublesome
world. She had taken life sighingly, in little frightened
gasps, as it were, with the fear upon her, even from
childhood, that unknown horrors lurked for her in each
day to which she was awakened. It can scarcely be said
that she had clung to life with any tenacity&mdash;rather with
the instinct of living; and she had fluttered out of it resignedly
enough, a little sorry, perhaps, that she had left
any one behind to grieve for her. And yet, with the inconsistency
which had marked her life, she had died at
the very moment when life had actually begun to be worth
living for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear&rdquo; was one of those who wait long for the happiness,
if any, that is to come to them, and find it a
little tasteless when it is at last given to them. She had
been the younger child of a stern and unbending man,
who bent or broke to his code of rules those who were
weak enough to be bent or broken, and thrust sternly
aside those whose strength opposed itself to his. He had
found in his little daughter one who smilingly and timidly
obeyed in everything, and worshipped him without question&mdash;up
to a certain point. That point was determined
by the arrival of David Willis.</p>

<p>It was an old and a very ordinary story; such stories
are played out to their bitter end day after day around
us. David Willis was poor, and had absolutely no expectations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
so far as old Robert Carlaw was concerned he
simply did not exist&mdash;except as many other people existed,
as a part of the world with which he had nothing to do.
David, for his part, was as patient and long-suffering as
the girl who loved him; and so they solemnly and pitifully
plighted their troth, and agreed to wait. Boldness or resource
of action was not in either of them; the girl, despite
her love for the man, and the sort of humble, patient
faithfulness with which she was endowed, would not have
risked her father&rsquo;s anger on any account. So, in a poor,
half-ridiculous, half-heroic fashion, they parted and
waited.</p>

<p>They waited, strange as it may seem, for nearly twenty
years; until the man had entered the forties and the
woman was nearing them. She was still a pretty woman,
soft-eyed and gentle of voice, with a great mine of tenderness
hidden away in her which no one had been able to
discover. When, on her father&rsquo;s death, she married David
Willis, there seemed a prospect that the mine would be
discovered, but the time had gone past; life had been so
long a flat and stale and unprofitable thing that the old
fierce heart-beats at the thought of her lover, the old
hunger of love for him, had died away into a mere tremulous
wonder as to whether he would be good to her, or
whether he might have moments of harshness and sternness,
like her father. She had hung too long expectant
on hope to believe that the world was going to be very
good to her now; she was only a little glad, for her lover&rsquo;s
sake, that his time of waiting was ended.</p>

<p>David Willis was a musician and a dreamer; not a very
great musician, and certainly a dreamer whose dreams
brought him no profit. He had filled the place of organist
in one or two minor churches, living simply and contentedly.
By the very irony of things, when the woman he
loved was able to come to him and put her hands in his,
and tell him that there was no further bar to their happiness,
he was out of an engagement, and had scarcely a
penny in the world. But, with a childlike faith which,
even at their years, came near to the sublime, they married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
first and tried to be worldly afterward. Fortunately
for them, her brother was a man of property in a small,
old-fashioned town near the coast of Kent; and, having
considerable influence in the place, he offered, through
the clergyman of the parish, the vacant post of organist
in the parish church to David Willis, after first roundly
abusing his sister for having married a pauper.</p>

<p>It was a quaint old town, a place of red roofs and
winding streets and strange old buildings; a very paradise
to the dreamer and the woman who had waited so
long for him. Her brother&rsquo;s house stood at the far end
of the town, in the newer part of it; but they saw little
of him, and had, indeed, no particular desire to do so.
They had their own quiet dwelling-place, a little house
nestling under the frowning shadows of the church
wherein he worked; a strange old place, with low ceilings
and black beams, with a garden of roses stretching right
along under the gray old church wall. Her life, for a
few months at least, was a sweet and shadowed thing;
people said afterward&mdash;people who had never known her&mdash;that
they had seen her sitting often in the old church,
with her mild eyes looking upward at a great rose window
over the porch, while her husband practised for the
services on the wheezy old organ; had seen her wandering
in her garden among the roses, singing to herself in a
subdued voice&mdash;the voice of one who has long been forced
to be silent, or to subdue any natural mirth that might be
in her.</p>

<p>The summer went by, while David Willis played on
his organ, and his wife sang among her roses; and with
the autumn came a new light in the eyes of the woman&mdash;a
light as of one who waits and hopes for something.
Poor, trembling, wistful creature, what dreams were hers
then! What dreams when she sat by her husband&rsquo;s side
in the twilight, looking out over the town where the lights
were beginning to twinkle one by one like sleepy eyes!
What dreams of a little life that was to recompense her
for all she had missed, and all she never could find in any
other way! Childish hands were to draw all that mine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of tenderness out of her, as no other hands could have
done; childish words were to wake echoing words in her
dull heart, and stir it to life again. She dreamed tremblingly
of all she would do; of all she would teach the
child; saw it walking by her side among the roses; fluttered
into church proudly, braving the eyes of younger
women with the mite beside her.</p>

<p>Those were dreams which never came true. She had
waited, through dull and spiritless years, for her chance
of life; it was written, in that book which no man shall
read, that her life in that fuller sense was to be but a
short one. She gave birth to her child&mdash;a boy&mdash;and knew
her fate even before they told her. She sank slowly,
drifting out of life with as little effort to retain it as
she had shown throughout her days. Almost the last
thing she did was to take her husband&rsquo;s hand, as he sat
speechless with grief beside her, and put it to her lips,
and draw it up against her cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We waited&mdash;a long time&mdash;Davie,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;I wish&mdash;I might&mdash;have&mdash;stayed.&rdquo; She did not speak
again; she held his hand in that position until the last
breath fluttered out of her lips.</p>

<p>David Willis was utterly incapable of appreciating
anything except the magnitude of his loss. He wandered
desolately from room to room, picking up things that had
belonged to her and putting his lips to them, and weeping,
in a hopeless, despairing fashion, like a child. Fortunately
for that other child who had been the direct
cause of the disaster, there were kindly people about the
place who cared for it, and found a nurse for it&mdash;a young
and healthy woman who had but just lost a child of her
own, and who was installed in the house of David Willis
at once. From that big house in the newer part of the
town came Mr. Robert Carlaw, the brother of the dead
woman, hushing his loud and blustering voice a little as
he crossed the threshold of the place of mourning.</p>

<p>He had an air with him, this Robert Carlaw; a sense of
saying, when he entered a room, that it was something
poorer and meaner than before he came; a magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
air of proprietorship in every one he honoured by a nod
or a handshake; the very town through which he walked
became, not a sweet and beautiful old place which seemed
to have been dropped clean out of the middle ages, but
an awkward, badly built little place in which Robert Carlaw
was good enough to live. The swing of him was so
fine that the skirts of his coat brushed the houses as he
went down the street; other passengers humbly took the
roadway.</p>

<p>He was very kind and sympathetic with David Willis,
with the kindness and sympathy of a patron to a dependent
who has suffered a loss; he had scarcely seen his
sister since she was a child, and knew absolutely nothing
of her. He seated himself in an armchair&mdash;the chair
which had been hers&mdash;opposite to where David Willis sat
with his head bowed in his hands; he coughed, with a
little shade of annoyance in the cough, as of one who is
not receiving proper attention. David Willis looked up
without speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad business, this,&rdquo; said Mr. Carlaw, with a jerk of
the head which was meant to convey that he referred to
what was lying upstairs. &ldquo;A man feels these things; I
know <i>I</i> did. Cut me up dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said David, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was never strong, you know,&rdquo; went on the
brother; &ldquo;not like the others, I mean. And then she
married late, which tries a woman, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other again in the same tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was just the sort that would give in without
making what I call a kick for it. Hadn&rsquo;t half enough of
the devil in her. Not a bit like her brother in that respect.
Why, I assure you, they&rsquo;ve positively <i>tried</i> to kill
me, half a dozen times; given me over for dead. But
they didn&rsquo;t know Bob Carlaw; he&rsquo;s always proved one
too many for &rsquo;em. There&rsquo;s a lot of life in Bob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David Willis got up slowly. &ldquo;Would you like to see
her?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; I don&rsquo;t think so. It wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t do
any good, and the sight of any one dead always upsets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
me. No, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll see her; I only&mdash;only called
in case I could do anything. A man needs sympathy at
such a time.&rdquo; He got up and took his hat, and swung
toward the door. Turning there, he said abruptly, &ldquo;What
about the kid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said David, looking at him blankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The child; is it alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied David; &ldquo;doing well, they tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;that&rsquo;s bad&mdash;for you, I mean.&rdquo; He paused a
moment, coughed uncomfortably, and stuck his hat sideways
on his head; then remembered himself, and took it
off and frowned at it. Finally he got out of the door
awkwardly, and swung himself out through the garden of
the roses and went up the street, trying hard not to
whistle.</p>

<p>It was on the day of the funeral that David Willis first
seemed to grasp the idea of his responsibility in regard
to his infant son. He had had no thought of that before;
had listened to the sympathizing remarks of the
few friends he had with indifference, and had scarcely appeared
to realize that there was a new element in his
life at all. He grasped things slowly at all times, and
required time to digest them; he had room for nothing
else in his mind then but the thought of his loss. The
day that saw her committed to the earth in the old
churchyard within sight of the garden where she had
walked was a day which passed for him like a troubled
dream; he had a vague remembrance that people were
very kind to him, and helped him, and told him what to
do and where to stand. It was while he stood beside the
grave that some words from the burial service broke upon
his ears as though nothing had been said before; he saw
in them something new and fresh and hopeful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time
to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lost all that followed; with those final words came
a new thought into his mind. The woman he had loved,
for whom he had waited and hungered so patiently, was
to sleep her last sleep in that quiet place, to sleep as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
calmly and as gently as she had lived. But there was
something more than this, something to comfort him.
God had, after all, been very merciful; so, in his simple
mind, he told himself. The poor, frail woman was gone;
in her place had come a little child. The words were
true; he applied them at once to the baby. &ldquo;He cometh
up&mdash;like a flower.&rdquo; Surely that was true; his eyes
brightened as he thought of it; the bitterness fell away
from his heart; he almost longed to leave her sleeping
there and to get back to the child. He scarcely seemed to
have seen the child yet&mdash;to know what it was like.</p>

<p>As he crossed the churchyard to his house the thing
was forced more clearly and strongly upon him; he saw,
with the fine instinct of love, that this was what she
would have wished, that the child must grow up to think
well of her, and to take her place. A man of rare singleness
of life and purpose, he had been capable only of
single emotions; and those emotions must, of necessity,
be great. His dogged patience in waiting for one woman
through all the best years of his life had had in it much
of heroism; that was ended, and he turned now to something
else to fill his days. The child should do it; the
child had been sent for that very purpose. Over and
over again the words came back to him, &ldquo;He cometh up&mdash;like
a flower.&rdquo; That was very beautiful; it seemed
strange that he had not thought of that before. He
dreamed a dream, even as the woman had done, of all
that the child was to be to him.</p>

<p>He went into the room where the scrap of humanity
lay sleeping against the strange woman&rsquo;s breast; the
woman glanced up at him almost resentfully as he bent
over the child; just such another child had lain warm
against her, and this one filled the void in her heart a
little. She was a humble creature, of no subtle emotions
whatever; her sense of motherhood, so recently awakened,
was the strongest feeling in her.</p>

<p>The man touched the baby&rsquo;s cheek with a hesitating
forefinger, and then turned away and walked out of the
room. He saw quite clearly how the child would grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
up, knowing only him, desiring no one else to fill its
world. Before another hour had passed, the solitary man
had mapped out the seat the child should take in the
house and in church; had wandered in fancy over the
fields through which the child should accompany him.
There was no disloyalty to the dead woman in all this;
the child had sprung out of the woman, in every sense,
and took her place quite naturally in the deep heart of
the man.</p>

<p>That evening David Willis received an unexpected
visitor. The visitor came slowly and timidly, and yet
with a certain forced air of defiance upon him, up the
garden path, and knocked at the door of the little house.
The one servant the house boasted, and who did not sleep
there, had gone to her own home at the other end of the
town; David Willis opened the door, and stared out into
the twilight at the visitor.</p>

<p>The caller was a little man&mdash;very alert and very upright,
with a tightly buttoned frock coat, and an old-fashioned
silk hat with a curly brim. He carried something
in one hand behind him. David Willis remembered
to have seen him once or twice in the streets, walking
very erect, and swinging a cane with a tassel attached to
it; and always in church on Sundays, where he occupied
a little odd pew in one corner, and gave the responses in
a very loud and sonorous voice not at all fitting to his
stature. David held the door in one hand, and looked
out wonderingly at the little man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Garraway-Kyle&mdash;Captain Garraway-Kyle&mdash;late
of her Majesty&rsquo;s service. You are in trouble,
sir, your wife&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped abruptly and coughed and
frowned, and tugged at one end of his white mustache
with his disengaged hand&mdash;&ldquo;your wife, sir, was good
enough to admire my flowers; used to stop sometimes to
look at them. I thought perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; His sunburned
face took on a deeper tinge, and he brought his hand
from behind him and showed a carefully arranged bunch
of flowers.</p>

<p>David Willis came out into the little path, and closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the door behind him; his voice was rather unsteady when
he spoke. &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Would you like
me to go with you and point out the&mdash;the grave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it. I was there this afternoon,&rdquo; replied the
captain, shortly. &ldquo;But I should like you to come with
me.&rdquo; So the two men went in silence out of the garden,
and by the little gate into the churchyard, David Willis
having no hat, and the captain carrying his in his hand.</p>

<p>At the grave the captain knelt stiffly, as though it were
an effort for him to do so, and put the flowers at the head
of the new mound. He remained for nearly half a
minute kneeling, and then drew himself up and faced the
other. &ldquo;She was a sweet and gentle woman, sir; I have
seen her often; I have ventured to peep over the wall
when she was in her own garden. She was very fond of
flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied David, &ldquo;very.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wished sometimes that I might have offered her
some of mine, the finest garden in the town, sir. But, of
course, I did not know her. I am sorry to have had to
give them to her like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; said David, softly.</p>

<p>Captain Garraway-Kyle turned away and looked up
for a moment at the sombre church which rose above
them. &ldquo;You had not been married long, I think, Mr.
Willis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite a year,&rdquo; replied David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! The child lives, I think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked back together to the gate which led to
the cottage; and there the captain held out his hand.
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, stiffly; and then, &ldquo;I am very sorry.
By the way&mdash;boy or girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a boy,&rdquo; replied David.</p>

<p>The captain had gone a few paces down the street
when he turned on his heel and came back again. &ldquo;I
beg your pardon, Mr. Willis, but what will you call him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was almost an idle question, prompted in the captain&rsquo;s
mind for want of something better to say; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
set the old train of thought running in David Willis&rsquo;s
mind as it had run all that afternoon. The words he had
heard at the grave-side seemed to sound in his ears again;
the sudden thought struck him to give the boy some name
that should keep in memory his mother, and the purpose
for which he came into the world, and all that he meant
to his father. He faced about, and looked at his visitor
with a new light in his eyes. &ldquo;I shall call him &lsquo;Comethup,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he said, slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The captain looked a little
startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Comethup,&rsquo;&rdquo; said David again, half to himself.
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see; family name, I presume?&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied David Willis, &ldquo;a family name. Good-night.&rdquo;
And he went inside, and sat down in the darkness
to think about it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="subheading">AND MAKES DISCOVERIES.</p>


<p>David Willis stuck to his determination, so suddenly
made on that night of the captain&rsquo;s visit, and the child
was duly baptized under the name of Comethup Willis.
Simple David Willis chuckled to himself a little over his
ingenuity; he grew to like the quaintness of the name,
and it was a constant reminder&mdash;if such were necessary&mdash;of
the tragedy which belonged to the boy&rsquo;s birth. He
always spoke the name rapidly when addressing the child
or when referring to it to any one else, slurring the cumbrous
name that he might hide the secret of it; only to
himself did he ever speak it slowly with the added words,
&ldquo;as a flower.&rdquo; It was a never-ceasing source of joy to
him to think how cleverly the name had been conceived;
he dwelt upon it lovingly, with the pride of the inventor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and it became on his tongue a caress whenever it was
uttered.</p>

<p>Apart from the mere name, the child filled his life and
his thoughts to a greater extent than he had ever even
dared to hope. He grew rapidly, and shook off the childish
ailments which came with his years with greater ease
than most children; he had about him, even as a little
fellow, the grave, shy tenderness of his mother. Captain
Garraway-Kyle murmured once, as he held him at arms&rsquo;-length
and looked critically at him, that he had his
mother&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>It was a strange life for the child, alone with a dreamy
man in that old house under the shadow of the church; if
he could have written down his impressions of life and
those about him at that time, they would have made
curious reading. He remembered when it was possible
for him, by a great effort, to get both hands up to the
door knob, and to twist it round and stagger backward,
pulling the door with him; understood fully what a steep
and treacherous affair the stone step was which led down
to the garden; and what a proud and wonderful day it
was when he summoned courage to step straight down
upon it, instead of manipulating the descent with one
small bare knee on the stone and the foot of the other
leg feeling for the earth below. He knew his mother&rsquo;s
garden by heart, and all the wondrous corners of it, where
strange things hid which no one saw but himself. He
learned early that the roses which grew there, and nodded
in a friendly fashion to him as he passed, only grew there
for a small boyish nose to be poked up at them to get
their scent, and were not to be pulled except on rare occasions,
when his father went round the garden with a
basket, and gathered the choicest, and tied them into a
rude kind of wreath. Comethup knew then that a great
expedition was on foot; that they would go out of the
gate at the farthest end of the garden, and that he would
stumble&mdash;holding fast by his father&rsquo;s hand&mdash;through a
place where the grass was very soft and very green, and
where some of it was raised in long hillocks higher than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the rest; a place where large flat stones with curious
marks upon them, and little babies&rsquo; heads with wings cut
on some, cropped up out of the earth. On one of these
hillocks the little homely wreath would be laid, and his
father would kneel and seem to whisper something behind
his hand. He knew that his mother slept there, and that
she would never wake up again, and never walk with him,
as his father walked, in the garden of the roses. Child
though he was, he always felt a little sadness as he stumbled
back over the hillocks to the garden gate, because
the mother he had never seen lay, an inscrutable mystery,
out of his sight under the grass.</p>

<p>There was one never-to-be-forgotten day when he first
learned of something outside his own small world. It
was Sunday, and the heavy old bells were swinging, and
his father had gone out through the sunlight with books
under his arm to the church. It struck suddenly upon
the child that this day was different from all the rest; that
the little maid-servant had a cleaner face and a whiter
apron, and that his own tiny suit was one which was laid
by in a tall old press all the rest of the week. Most of
our impressions, whatever age we may be, come to us
through the sense of smell, and Comethup&rsquo;s impression of
the day came to him through the scent of the clothes.
They bore the same scent as the big best bedroom upstairs&mdash;a
room in which no one ever slept and into which
he had peeped one day when the door was open; just such
a scent as that which hung about it had been wafted out
to his nostrils then. He began to see that there must be
something &ldquo;best&rdquo; about this day also, as there was about
everything connected with it.</p>

<p>When David Willis came back from church, the child
had got his questions ready, and knew exactly what answers
he required, as a child always unerringly does. He
asked why all the shops along the other side of the street
were closed, and why the bells rang on that day, and
why the people sang in the big church which loomed above
them. And then he heard for the first time of that other
world into which we try so hard to peer; of that dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Presence&mdash;dread to a child&mdash;beyond the skies that shuts
in our vision. He was puzzled to understand how his
mother could be right above him, watching to see if he
were a good boy or a bad; and why, in that case, those
flowers were put upon that grass-covered bed of hers out
in the churchyard. He pondered the matter deeply, and
was much disconcerted to think that the God of whom
every one seemed so much afraid was all round him and
could see everything he did.</p>

<p>He went one day into the church with his father&mdash;an
experience indeed! It was quite empty, save for themselves,
and the first thought that occurred to him was to
wonder where the roof was; and why his voice rumbled
and rattled and sprang at him from far above when he
incautiously spoke in his usual shrill treble. The phrase
which his father used&mdash;&ldquo;the house of God&rdquo;&mdash;awed him;
he understood why the roof was so much higher than that
of their own house. A lovely pattern of many colours
on the stone pavement at his feet arrested his attention.
He followed the shafts of light upward to the great rose
window high up in the wall over the porch. His heart
went a little quicker, and he gripped his father&rsquo;s hand
with his baby fingers. That surely must be the eye of
God looking down at him.</p>

<p>He went home tremblingly to think the matter over;
saw in the childish wonder of discovery something that no
one had found before; screwed his courage to make further
inquiries of his father concerning this dread Being.
It was a terror to him to learn that the Being was everywhere,
not alone in the great place where people went in
their best clothes to worship him. He crept up to his
tiny bedroom under the roof that night, and hurriedly
closed the door and drew the curtains, and lay in bed
quakingly triumphant at the thought that he had shut It
out, only to wake up with a start in a little while at
the remembrance that It must have been in the room before
his precautions were taken. He climbed out of bed,
and pattered across to the window; pulled back the curtains,
and pushed open the casement. All the benign influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of a summer starlight night was about him; the
lights were twinkling sleepily and safely down in the
town; and he could hear calm, slow country voices in the
street beyond the garden. Life&mdash;great and wonderful to
his childish mind, although bounded by so narrow a horizon&mdash;seemed
beautiful and good and secure; he smiled,
and dropped his sleepy head on his arms on the window
ledge, and slept there calmly till the morning came.</p>

<p>The world is always a place of giants to us when we
are very little; therein lies the tragedy and the terror of
it. We are always told that childhood is such a happy
time; we cry always how gladly we would return to it.
But we know well that we would not return to it with the
ignorance with which we left it; that we should go back
to its delights and its irresponsibilities with the magician&rsquo;s
wand of Experience in our hands to make it a fairyland.
To a lonely child the world in which he lives is
a place of terrors, with no one who understands his needs
to explain to him all he craves so desperately to know.</p>

<p>Comethup was left pretty much to his own devices in
those early days. David Willis liked to have the boy
near him, liked to see him moving about the house. But,
in his dreamy fashion, he took but scant notice of the
child as a child; he painted to himself glowing pictures
of what the boy would be when he had grown older and
was ripe for companionship; for the present, he waited a
little impatiently for that time to come. So it happened
that Comethup explored his world alone.</p>

<p>The seasons seemed always to come suddenly. He
would wake up, bright and alert, on a glorious morning of
sunshine, with an endless prospect of sunny days before
him; fires were things of the past, and the garden was no
more a sealed place, wherein he must not run for fear
of splashing his little white legs with mud. In just the
same way there seemed no intermediate time between the
summer, with its glorious abundance of roses and its
long, hot afternoons, and the time when the roses were
gone, and he was curled up like a little comfortable animal
on the hearthrug before the parlour fire. That was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the time, too, for going to bed in the dark, when the
dreadful hour crept inexorably on; when he must leave
the warmth and brightness of the lower room and climb
with reluctant feet into a colder atmosphere, where grim
shadows lurked on the landing, and the pale moon grinned
in at him through an uncurtained window, like a queer
face all on one side.</p>

<p>The church grew, quite naturally, from its mystic
qualities, to be his chief delight. Everything about it
was wonderful, from the long flight of stone steps which
led up to the organ-loft where his father played, to the
great brown wooden bird, with its beak open, and with
outstretched wings, which stood on a carved pillar before
the altar. Its seats were a never-failing source of delight
to the shy child&mdash;places in which one could hide,
secure from every one, and look up at the great roof, and
at the sunlight slanting in through the windows. But
perhaps it was best of all to sit up in the organ-loft, as
he sometimes did with his father; to draw a huge hassock
close up against the old-fashioned wooden partition, and
sit there and look down, unseen and unsuspected, at the
people below. Comethup always stood up at the proper
places on those occasions, and sat down when the people
rustled into their seats; he tried, too, to murmur something
which sounded a little like the responses which rumbled
up from below.</p>

<p>His world widened out a little as the placid years
flowed on. The garden of the roses no longer bounded
his horizon; the gate ceased to be a barrier which must
not be passed. The spirit of adventure was strong in
Comethup one summer afternoon, when his father was
sleeping peacefully on the hard horsehair sofa in the parlour,
and the little maid who waited upon them was
busied in the kitchen. The garden had been all explored;
on such a day as this, when the air was heavy and still,
the very scent of the roses hung heavily. Poor Comethup
was a little tired of roses&mdash;a little tired even of that
wonderful garden, every corner of which, every stick and
stone, he knew by heart. And then, just as he clung to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the iron railings of the gate, and looked out disconsolately
into the quiet street, there came a playmate.</p>

<p>It was a dog; a mere boisterous, happy-go-lucky, tumbling,
joyous puppy of a few months; a thing of comical
crinkled mouth and serious eyes, a delightful romping
rascal that loved the world and hailed every creature
friend. It stopped opposite the gate where Comethup
stood, and backed itself upon its ridiculous little haunches
and inch of tail, and barked deliriously; then dashed off
a foot or two in excited chase of something which didn&rsquo;t
exist; and then, suddenly remembering Comethup, returned
madly to the assault, thrusting its little black
nose under the gate in a frantic endeavour to bite Comethup&rsquo;s
little white socks.</p>

<p>It was irresistible. Comethup cautiously pulled open
the gate, trembling at his daring as he did so, and went
down on the gravel on his knees, clapping his hands, and
doing all in his power to induce the puppy to come to him.</p>

<p>But that wary animal knew better than that. He
backed away, moving his stump of tail convulsively, and,
as Comethup followed on hands and knees, backed away
farther still out of reach. Finally the puppy scrambled
off sideways, going through the most extraordinary gyrations
and looking back at the child with one ear cocked
up, and then dashing off again sideways, tripping himself
up occasionally in his haste. Comethup got to his feet
and set off down the pavement after the puppy, leaving
the garden gate wide open.</p>

<p>The sternness of the chase awoke in Comethup&rsquo;s
blood; he determined to have that puppy at all costs&mdash;to
feel the soft, warm, live, struggling thing in his arms.
Twice he was certain he had it; had dropped all over
it, so to speak, in a frantic endeavour to clasp it. But the
thing slid from under his arms and impudently snapped
at his very nose, and was off again. At last, however, he
ran it to earth in a corner, where it promptly rolled over
on its back, with its four legs in the air, and surrendered.</p>

<p>By that time Comethup had lost his way; but that fact
was of the smallest possible moment. He was in a glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
city he had not seen before; a place of curious old
houses bending their upper windows toward each other as
though to whisper; of long, quaint gardens thick with
Old-World flowers&mdash;stocks and hollyhocks, and others beloved
of our grandmothers; with another church, not so
magnificent or so large as the one he knew, but older and
quainter, with a great brass dial up on one wall from
which a brass finger projected to show the shadow of the
afternoon sun. The puppy was struggling in his arms,
jerking itself frantically upward to lick his round, baby
face, and to softly bite his chin. That of course was disconcerting;
but Comethup managed to take in a great
deal with his eyes nevertheless.</p>

<p>He managed, among other things, to take in the figure
of an upright old gentleman with a heavy gray mustache,
who was clipping and trimming with a pair of scissors in
one of the gardens. Comethup had just stopped, out of
the politest curiosity, to watch him, when the old gentleman
swung round and marched toward the gate, and
cried violently, pointing a finger at the child, &ldquo;What the
devil are you doing with my dog, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Comethup had never been spoken to in that
fashion before; he began to see in the old gentleman
retributive justice sweeping down upon him for having
left his father&rsquo;s garden&mdash;above all, for having left the
gate open, an unpardonable thing. He would have liked
to drop the puppy, but remembered in time that he might
hurt it; so he lowered it gently to the ground, where it
at once commenced tugging at his shoestrings. With as
much dignity as he could command under the circumstances,
Comethup tremblingly began to explain that he
had found it.</p>

<p>Before he had finished a half-dozen words, however,
the little old gentleman, with an exclamation, had pulled
the gate open, and had come out upon the pavement.
Comethup began to tremble very much indeed, but the
old gentleman took him&mdash;not unkindly&mdash;by the chin, and
turned his face up so that he might look at it. Comethup
must have looked very appealing indeed, for the old gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
suddenly smiled, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s little
Comethup!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Comethup humbly.</p>

<p>The captain, without a word, picked up the puppy with
one hand and offered the other to the child. They went
up the garden path together, into a quaint little room,
where everything was very bright and very straight and
very orderly; very poor, too, if Comethup had but known.
There the old gentleman lifted him into a chair, and
rang the bell. Then he turned round, in his abrupt
fashion, and held out the struggling puppy with one hand
toward Comethup. &ldquo;You like this dog?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Comethup faintly admitted that he did.</p>

<p>The old gentleman thrust it into his arms. &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Be good to it, and feed it well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup tried to thank him, but at that moment the
puppy had taken him at a mean disadvantage, and was
dancing about frantically in his arms, and dabbing a
tongue much too large for it against his face, so that
speech was difficult. And just then a man came in, taller
than the old gentleman, and much more erect; and put
the back of his hand quite suddenly up to his forehead,
and held it there for a moment, and then brought the
hand down smartly with a smack against the side of
his leg.</p>

<p>Comethup became vastly interested in a moment; he
almost dropped the puppy in his excitement. He knew
that only one class of people did that kind of thing; the
little maid at home, whose sweetheart was a soldier from
Canterbury, had told him all about it. He began to
speculate on what wonderful house this could be, where
this sort of thing went on quite as a matter of course,
and no one seemed to think anything of it. In a vague
way he wondered if he could persuade his father to let
the little maid move her hand and arm like that whenever
she came into the parlour at home; it would be something
to look forward to&mdash;something to ring the bell for.</p>

<p>The old gentleman ordered tea, and the man who had
stood stiffly by the doorway went through the same wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
performance again and disappeared. Comethup&rsquo;s
curiosity swept away every other consideration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, in an awed voice, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <i>was</i>,&rdquo; returned the old gentleman, shortly. Then
stooping near to the boy, with both hands resting on the
table, he asked, with a curious tenderness in his voice,
&ldquo;Where did you get those eyes, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup did not remember the other occasion on
which Captain Garraway-Kyle had said that he had the
eyes of his dead mother; he did not even know that this
old gentleman was Captain Garraway-Kyle. He looked
up innocently, and smiled, and said he didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got &rsquo;em from your mother, boy,&rdquo; said the captain,
almost in a whisper, still looking at him earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s in heaven,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, boy, true,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, patting
him gently on the shoulder and turning away. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
very true. Your mother was a saint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup had not the least idea what a saint was,
but he knew it must be something very good, because the
old gentleman looked so serious. The arrival of tea put
an end to further conversation, and Comethup looked
out eagerly for the man to go through his performance,
which he did, to the child&rsquo;s great delight, as he was leaving
the room.</p>

<p>The abrupt old captain was as gentle as a woman with
the child; busied himself to mix milk and water for him,
and to spread jam on bread. It was only toward the end
of the meal that Comethup suddenly remembered the
chief adventure of the afternoon; that he had left the
safe line which bounded his daily life, and was with
strangers in an altogether different world. Even the possession
of the puppy could not wholly console him; his
lips began to quiver, and it was with some difficulty that
he made the captain understand. The captain assured
him, with much earnestness, that he knew the garden
where the roses were, and that he knew Comethup&rsquo;s
father, and the little maid, and the church, and everything.
Comethup was comforted, and the strange spectacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
was presented to the town, about half an hour later,
of Captain Garraway-Kyle, as closely buttoned as ever,
and with his hat a little more fiercely tilted than usual,
holding Comethup by the hand, on the way to David Willis&rsquo;s
house; Comethup, for his part, clutching the puppy
with difficulty but with determination.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="subheading">THE GHOST OF A LITTLE CHILD.</p>


<p>That was but the first of many walks and talks with
Captain Garraway-Kyle. Comethup grew to look upon
him as something very fine and very splendid; learned
from him, too, a very fine and very splendid morality,
which his dreamy father, for all the beauty of his character,
could scarcely have taught him. In those early
days everything had, of necessity, to pass the strong test
of the captain&rsquo;s frown or approving nod; each action was
court-martialled, as it were, and approved or utterly rejected,
as the case might be. There was no dividing line
with the captain; he had lived by stern rules all his life,
and a thing was either perfectly right or it was perfectly
wrong. Comethup&rsquo;s friendship with the captain was
probably the best thing that ever happened for him; he
grew up, under the old man&rsquo;s guidance, a pure and sweet
and wholesome little fellow, with a soul as clear as crystal.</p>

<p>From the captain&rsquo;s standpoint, also, the friendship was
a good thing. The old man bore himself as erectly as he
had ever done; only to Comethup he relaxed somewhat
the hard and unbending set of laws which hitherto had
governed his days. The stern old face broke up into
something of tenderness at the sight of the child; he prepared,
out of his scanty means, little treats and relishes
for the boy&rsquo;s entertainment. David Willis he never quite
understood; saw in him something out of the normal&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
creature sent into the world, he sincerely trusted, for
some good purpose; only the captain had not been able to
make up his mind what that purpose was. The captain
liked him, even pitied him a little, as he had pitied him
on the first night of their meeting; but the man was beyond
his range of vision. When, in church sometimes,
he heard the organ pealing out above him, he would
glance round at the child (for Comethup came in time to
occupy a seat in the captain&rsquo;s pew), and a little curious
look of anxiety would gather on his brow and settle there&mdash;anxiety
as to what the boy would do in the years that
were coming to him, and how his father would help to
equip him for the world. But, for the most part, the
captain was willing to let the happy present time go on,
grateful that, in the last of his years, this little child
should have come to sweeten them.</p>

<p>Great excursions were planned in those early days of
Comethup&rsquo;s life. It was a wonderful thing to see Comethup
do what no other living creature in the town dared
do so boldly&mdash;open the gate of the captain&rsquo;s garden, and
march straight up the trim little path which led to the
front door of the house. He had been taught, when an
expedition was afoot, to be punctual to the minute; and
he always found the captain coming out of the cottage as
he reached it, glancing generally at his watch with a quick
nod of approval. Then would the captain, with hat a-tilt
and cane swinging, and with pride in his heart, sally forth
with Comethup to make new discoveries on a prearranged
plan. For the old town, which had once been a mere resting-place
for the captain&rsquo;s declining years, took on a new
aspect, when viewed through the eyes of this child.</p>

<p>It was an old town&mdash;a beautiful old town; the captain
read up a complete history of it, and proved&mdash;to Comethup&rsquo;s
entire satisfaction as well as to his own&mdash;that something
extraordinary had happened in nearly every house
it contained. It had been a town of great deeds; had
once touched the sea, and had helped to defend that part
of the coast line during some of the country&rsquo;s stormiest
times. The sea had long since retreated, and left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
little place lying high and dry, to sleep in peace, and
dream about its deeds.</p>

<p>It had been a walled town, too; indeed, the old wall
still remained, only that, in the very place and beauty of
less stirring times, the wall had become a mere grass-grown
bank, with flowers and shrubs growing all about it.
But here the captain was in his element; he could point
out how the town would be attacked from this direction,
or how an invading force would come from there; would
draw sketches in the gravel with the point of his cane to
illustrate exactly how <i>he</i> would have defended it, had
he been alive in those times, and how he would have
made it absolutely impregnable. Comethup, gazing at
him with delighted eyes, came to believe that he was absolutely
the greatest general and master of the art of war
that had ever existed, instead of a poor little half-pay
captain whose name had never been heard of.</p>

<p>There was a quiet and sleepy little river, too, which
ran just outside the town under a stone bridge; and the
captain used to lean over the parapet of the bridge, on
sunny afternoons, while Comethup sat on the stonework
beside him, and they used to fish for the bright, gleaming,
darting little creatures in the river below. They
very rarely caught anything: it was a great event when
they did; but the captain used to explain exactly how
various kinds of fishing could be accomplished with the
minimum of ease and the maximum of success. The
captain always seemed to know how to tell one the best
way of doing a variety of clever things, but he never
seemed to have accomplished very much in a practical
sense; Comethup used to think sadly, in after years, that
if the captain had only been able to do half the things
he could tell other people how to do, he might have been
a general at the very least, with his breast ablaze of
medals and orders. But Comethup loved him devotedly,
just as he was, and would not have had him changed for
the wide world.</p>

<p>A great wide expanse of sandy, marshy land lay between
the little town and the sea, and this was their playground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
It was a wonderful place&mdash;a place they seemed
never to be able fully to explore. The captain never quite
lost his dignity; but away from the town and under the
influence of Comethup he relaxed considerably. It is
always possible that he comforted himself with the reflection
that, whatever species of amusement they sought,
it was of an educational character, and would assist the
boy&rsquo;s future. But the Captain Garraway-Kyle who
marched out of the little town, holding the child by the
hand and swinging his cane, was a very different person indeed
from the light-hearted old gentleman who imperilled
the knees of his tight trousers in stooping over sand
forts and anxiously superintending the erection of fortifications.
The puppy&mdash;grown a little older and wiser and
more staid now&mdash;usually accompanied them on these expeditions,
and was not always to be trusted when a delicate
matter of building was on hand, having a propensity
for playing the enemy and levelling earthworks and forts
and everything else in one indiscriminate heap. So pleasant
days went by, each filled full to the last sleepy hour
with new experiences for Comethup; and the captain
seemed to grow younger as Comethup inevitably grew
older.</p>

<p>It has been said that Comethup often occupied a seat
in the captain&rsquo;s pew in church; it became quite a regular
thing for him to do so after a time. The child had drawn
two lonely men together, and, although the captain did
not understand David Willis, while David, for his part,
stood a little in awe of the captain&rsquo;s brusqueness, the two
men often met, and it became quite an ordinary thing
for them to sit chatting in David Willis&rsquo;s modest parlour
long after Comethup was tucked up in his little bed
at the top of the house. They were both inordinately
fond of the child; probably the captain excelled in that
particular. They never had very much to say to each
other, and when they spoke at all it was generally about
that one subject of their thoughts. The captain would
recount some bright speech of the boy&rsquo;s that he had
caught during the day, and David Willis would nod in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
sympathy and smile. Then the captain, after a puff or two
at his pipe, would exclaim half sternly: &ldquo;Fine boy, fine
boy, Willis. Make a man of him some day.&rdquo; And on
Sunday mornings the captain would come marching down
the street, and his eyes would gleam a little at sight of a
tiny figure drawn up erect at the salute inside the open
gateway of David Willis&rsquo;s garden. The captain would return
the salute, to Comethup&rsquo;s intense delight, and the
two would go gravely round the corner and through the
churchyard into the church.</p>

<p>Sitting beside the captain, Comethup would have leisure,
in the dim light of the place, to examine the old
man&rsquo;s hands as they were folded calmly over his prayer-book
on his lap. The child often wondered how they
could ever have held a sword, and how many people the
captain, in his days of war, had killed; the hands were so
soft and white, and their touch on his own small fingers
or on his shoulder had always been so light and gentle,
that it seemed impossible that they could have been made
for any stronger deeds. Comethup was always more desperately
fond of the captain on Sundays than on any
other days; partly because the captain, in his best black
coat, and with his hat off, looked so very small and old
and gray and lonely in the big pew, and partly because
Comethup was so passionately grateful to him&mdash;perfect
old gentleman that he was&mdash;for his kindly patronage of
so very small and insignificant a person as himself. He
was quite proud to be seen walking with the captain out
of church, and holding his hand; he reflected with pardonable
vanity more than once that there were very few
people in the world, at least as far as he knew it, who
were privileged to go to church every Sunday with so
great a warrior.</p>

<p>The pew behind that in which the captain and Comethup
sat was usually unoccupied; but on one particular
Sunday a little commotion was caused in the quiet old
church by the entry of two people into it. They came
late, after the service had commenced, and they made
some noise in getting into their seats. Comethup saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
heads turned, and people whisper among themselves. He
would greatly have liked to look round, as others were
doing; he was consumed with curiosity. But the captain
was looking straight in front of him, and even frowning
a little, and Comethup had to do the same.</p>

<p>Comethup came to the conclusion, before the service
was ended, that the newcomers behind them, whoever they
might be, had not been taught how to behave properly in
church. One of them, who seemed to be a man, gave the
responses in a very loud key, and sometimes very carelessly
quite in the wrong places; he breathed very heavily&mdash;Comethup
was almost persuaded, but that it seemed
so terrible, that he snored&mdash;during the sermon; and some
one else in the pew moved about a great deal, and
dropped books, and kicked and shuffled with his feet.
The captain grew more and more stern and frowning as
the service went on, so that Comethup was quite afraid
at last to look at him.</p>

<p>As they were passing out of church, the people from
the pew behind walked in front&mdash;a very tall and portly
gentleman, whose coat tails seemed to swing very much
as he walked, and a boy a year or two older than Comethup.
In the porch the gentleman swung on his hat, almost
before he had passed through the door, with a flourish;
glancing behind him as he went out, he caught sight of
the captain, and nodded and spoke: &ldquo;Aha! captain, delightful
day; had no idea you belonged to the good folk.
Who&rsquo;s our young friend?&rdquo; He indicated Comethup, who
was watching him with something of admiration.</p>

<p>The captain did not seem well pleased; he clipped his
words very short, in a fashion he had when angry, as he
replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not; how should I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let me present you,&rdquo; said the captain, keeping
fast hold of Comethup&rsquo;s hand, and making an ironically
elaborate business of the introduction. &ldquo;Master Comethup
Willis&mdash;Mr. Robert Carlaw.&mdash;Comethup,&rdquo; he added,
his tone changing as he addressed the child, &ldquo;this is your
Uncle Bob.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The portly gentleman seemed surprised, but passed the
thing off easily. &ldquo;Most extraordinary,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;though why the devil Willis ever called the unfortunate
creature by that outlandish name passes my comprehension.&mdash;How
do you do, nephew? I suppose I ought to have
remembered your existence long since; but I&rsquo;m such a
careless rascal that I leave undone those things which I
ought to have done&mdash;if you&rsquo;re a good churchman you&rsquo;ll
know the rest, without my troubling to repeat it. Here&rsquo;s
your cousin Brian; if you&rsquo;re half as much trouble to your
poor old dad as he is to me, I pity that worthy fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain was obviously anxious to get away, but
Comethup had been looking at the boy to whom he was
now introduced, and had, in a childish, worshipping fashion,
been quite fascinated by him. He was rather taller
than Comethup, and very well dressed, and was, moreover,
an extremely handsome boy. He had a rather high forehead
for a child, and very thick, curling brown hair
brushed loosely back from it. His eyes were keen and
bold and dark, and gave Comethup the odd impression of
being able to see a great deal more than the eyes of other
people. He held himself very upright, with his legs
rather apart, and his hands thrust in his pockets; and he
swaggered a little as he walked, like his father. He put
out his hand to Comethup, and smiled so beautifully with
a smile which made his face glow and change, that Comethup
was quite glad to think that he was his cousin; he
almost felt that he loved him from that moment.</p>

<p>David Willis came at that moment from the church,
with his books under his arm; he gazed in an absent-minded
fashion at the little group, and obviously did not
quite know what to make of it all. Uncle Bob came blusteringly
to the rescue; shook David heartily by the hand
and walked off with him, with a hand clapped confidentially
upon his shoulder and his head bent down sideways
from his greater height to talk to him. The boy
Brian walked along on the other side of his father, glancing
back over his shoulder now and then with an engaging
smile at Comethup, who followed behind with the captain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
The captain was ill at ease and in a bad temper;
he puffed out his chest as he walked and breathed
heavily under his mustache, and made savage little
cuts at the air with his cane, as though it had been a
sword.</p>

<p>At the gate leading to the garden Mr. Robert Carlaw
parted jovially, shaking David heartily by the hand again,
and patting Comethup on the top of his best Sunday cap.
In the captain he apparently scented an enemy; they
bowed to each other stiffly, and the frown did not leave
the captain&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must come and see us,&rdquo; said Mr. Carlaw, with a
jerk of the head toward Comethup. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be company
for each other; besides, they&rsquo;re cousins. You&rsquo;re such
quiet folks; I declare I&rsquo;d forgotten your existence&mdash;absolutely
forgotten it.&rdquo; He went swinging away down the
street, with the boy swinging beside him, a curious, almost
pathetic imitation of the father.</p>

<p>It had become the captain&rsquo;s habit to dine with David
Willis every Sunday&mdash;quite a simple, homely dinner of a
joint and vegetables and a pudding to follow. The captain
walked into the cottage now, sat himself stiffly
down in a chair near the window, and drew Comethup
against his knee and put his arm about him. David
Willis was wandering about the room, softly humming to
himself a fragment of the voluntary he had played that
morning, while the servant-maid laid the table. It was
a hot and breathless summer morning; the window of
the little parlour was wide open, and Comethup could hear
people passing and repassing in the street beyond the garden;
could hear the murmur of their talk. There was a
high, old-fashioned mahogany bureau on the other side
of the room, with curved brass handles to the drawers,
and with three leather-bound books, growing gradually
smaller in size upward, like a pyramid, on the top of it.
Comethup had never seen either the books or the bureau
opened; it was curious, therefore, to see his father, with a
smile on his face, stroll across there presently and lift
the topmost book and open it. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
friend Carlaw was something of a poet, did you?&rdquo; he
asked, addressing the captain.</p>

<p>Disgust sprang suddenly into the captain&rsquo;s eyes, and
into the lines about his mouth. &ldquo;A poet? Yes, I could
have believed even <i>that</i> of him.&rdquo; The captain chuckled
a little grimly at his own humour.</p>

<p>David Willis laughed, and brought the book over toward
the window, turning the leaves slowly and looking
into it. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he wrote these when he was
quite a young man; they were published by subscription.
He was a mere youth at the time, and he gave this copy
to his sister, my wife. It&rsquo;s very queer reading, very mad
reading some of it. He&rsquo;s a queer fellow, and a mad fellow.&rdquo;
David Willis laughed good-humouredly and closed
the book and carried it back to the bureau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s mad enough,&rdquo; said the captain shortly. &ldquo;I
know the sort of man&mdash;met dozens of his kidney. They
flash through the world, spreading their feathers in the
sun and making such a flutter that no one sees what
shame and misery they leave in their track; or, if any one
does see it, it&rsquo;s all excused with the phrase, &lsquo;Oh, he
couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;he was such a good fellow.&rsquo; Bah!&rdquo; The
captain was quite indignant, and the arm that held Comethup
shook a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little hard on our friend,&rdquo; said David,
easily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really rather a clever sort of fellow; there
are lots of things he does quite well, only not quite well
enough to make anything of them. He paints a little,
writes a little, plays and sings remarkably well. But he
never gives his mind to anything. I remember he said to
me once: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault; they shouldn&rsquo;t have given me
such a name. Think of it! Bob! What can a fellow do
with such a name as that, except go to the devil with it?
And I&rsquo;ve tried consistently to go to the devil with it.&rsquo;
And I really believe he has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I dare say he has,&rdquo; replied the captain, a little
wearily. &ldquo;And there you have the whole man in a nutshell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup was destined very soon to see more of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
fascinating boy, and of his father. But a few days had
gone by when the shadow of Robert Carlaw loomed large
in the open doorway of the cottage, and he came in, followed
by Brian. He seemed to take up an immense
amount of room, and to block out the light a great deal,
in whatever part of the room he stood. It was immediately
after breakfast&mdash;David Willis always breakfasted
late, a habit he had acquired when living in town&mdash;and
David was smoking a pipe before setting about those
small duties which occupied his day. David Willis had
on a very shabby coat and slippers on his feet; Robert
Carlaw&rsquo;s coat was of the finest, his boots shone magnificently,
and he smoked a cigar. He announced airily
that he had come to carry off his little friend with the
extraordinary name; the name, he declared, was too much
to pronounce in such weather as that, but he didn&rsquo;t love
him any the less on account of it, and meant to carry him
off, for the day at least. So Comethup was duly made
ready and went away with a fluttering heart on the other
side of Uncle Bob, peeping round his portly person, as
he trotted along, to catch a glimpse of that fascinating
boy who walked on the farther side of him.</p>

<p>It had been a whim on the part of Mr. Robert Carlaw;
he had suddenly made up his mind that he ought to
see the child&mdash;had suddenly remembered that it was the
child of his dead sister, and, in a fashion quite characteristic
of him, he had dashed off, hot with the purpose, at
the very moment the thought occurred to him.</p>

<p>He even devised schemes as he went along between
them for their entertainment. They would do this, they
would do that; they would have tea in the garden, or a
pony chaise should be hired, and he would take them for
a drive. A hundred alluring schemes were in his mind;
he seemed to enter joyously and childishly into their
world, and to understand exactly what would suit them
best. But, by the time he reached his own house with
them, the keenness of the business was done, the edge of
it had worn off. He rambled with them, in a perfunctory
fashion, round the garden, but he was obviously tiring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Quite suddenly, on an excuse, he left them and shut himself
up in a room he called his workroom, and they saw
no more of him.</p>

<p>Brian did not seem in the least surprised; his lip
curled a little disdainfully when Comethup politely inquired
whether his father was unwell. Comethup had a
curious impression that this boy, although he obviously
admired his father very much, and even imitated him,
yet saw through him in some way and knew him to be
not quite so nice as other people imagined. There was a
careless, curt fashion of dismissing his father&rsquo;s name
which Comethup could not have employed in the case of
<i>his</i> father for the world, and which made him a little
afraid of his cousin in consequence.</p>

<p>The house must have been a very beautiful one at
some time; it was filled even now with many beautiful
articles of furniture, articles such as Comethup had
never seen, and many of which he did not know the use
of. But everything was in hopeless confusion and disorder;
valuable articles broken and thrust aside, and
something equally valuable put in its place to serve its
purpose. Books lay about in every room of the house&mdash;some
of them flung, with wide-open leaves, by impatient
hands into corners; fine engravings were stood in their
frames against the wall, because no one had ever troubled
to hang them up; many of them had their glasses broken,
and most of them were smothered in dust, or torn, or
otherwise maltreated. Some stood in rolls in the corners
of the rooms. It seemed, in every way, the house of a
man who meant many things&mdash;even meant to live beautifully;
but of a man who had never, in anything, got far
beyond the mere fluttering resolutions.</p>

<p>But it was nevertheless a house of delights to the
child&mdash;a place of never-ending wonder. Only, in the
midst of their exploration, Comethup suddenly remembered
that he had that afternoon made an appointment
with Captain Garraway-Kyle, and that that appointment
must be kept. There was a sort of tremor at his heart
when he remembered how the captain would be standing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
just within the door of his cottage, with his watch on his
palm, waiting for him at the hour named. He informed
Brian that he must really go.</p>

<p>The boy looked at him in astonishment; a shade of
annoyance crossed his face. &ldquo;Oh, put him off!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Comethup shook his head very decidedly; he was
troubled, like the gentle little creature he was, at the
thought that he would have to show any discourtesy to
his cousin; but it was quite imperative that he should
meet the captain, and the thing had to be managed somehow.
&ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly do that. The captain and
I are very great friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian looked at the sober young face for a moment,
and then burst into a roar of laughter. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s so
old!&rdquo; he said, when he had recovered his gravity.</p>

<p>Comethup shook his head again, and smiled. &ldquo;Not
when you know him,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Sometimes he seems
almost as young as I am, only ever so much wiser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other boy stared at him curiously. &ldquo;Why, how
old are you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven next week,&rdquo; replied Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m nine.&rdquo; Giving the other time to digest his
superiority, he presently added: &ldquo;Must you really go and
see this old chap? You can easily explain afterward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup did not waver, but he decided to effect a
compromise. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come too?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He would be very glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian looked a little ruefully round the untidy room
in which they stood, and decided rapidly that it would
be better to do that than to remain in the house alone.
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; he said, and darted out into the hall
for his cap.</p>

<p>Comethup ventured a suggestion. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you&mdash;won&rsquo;t
you ask your father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian laughed, and tossed Comethup&rsquo;s cap to him.
&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Dad never knows where I am. All
I have to do is to keep out of the way when I&rsquo;m not
wanted, and be right at his elbow when he thinks he&rsquo;d like
to see me. Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to run,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They arrived breathless at the captain&rsquo;s cottage, and
found the captain, as Comethup had expected, standing
with his watch in his hand. He raised his eyebrows at
the sight of a second visitor, and Comethup breathlessly
explained the situation and tried to make a polite little
speech, apologizing for having introduced a visitor without
an invitation. But the captain interrupted him by
saying stiffly that his cousin was very welcome, and the
three set out for the usual walk together.</p>

<p>Somehow or other that afternoon the expedition was
not quite a success. In the first place, Comethup and the
captain were not quite at their ease; had, in fact, a ridiculous
feeling of being on their best behaviour before a
stranger. Then, too, the old innocent games&mdash;the building
of forts, and the pleasant little make-believe world
they had created&mdash;were things they did not care to venture
upon before this boy, whose scornful laughter
seemed to come so easily. They sat on a wooden seat
on the top of the grass-grown wall of the town, and found
themselves talking nicely, as Comethup would have put it,
and being very stiff and unnatural and dull in consequence.
The captain did not talk about his battles; was
quite reserved, in fact, and difficult to lure into any expression
of opinion. Comethup, proud of his old friend
and of his old friend&rsquo;s achievements, tried to draw him
on to descriptions of happenings with which he himself
was beautifully familiar, but which he felt would be interesting
to Brian, and give that young gentleman a finer
idea of the captain. But the captain was not to be
drawn; seemed, indeed, purposely to forget things which
had rattled glibly off his tongue but yesterday.</p>

<p>They saw Comethup safely to the gate of his father&rsquo;s
garden, and the captain gravely shook hands with him;
knowing his mood, Comethup was positively afraid to
salute, and, indeed, the stern eye of the captain forbade
it. Brian&rsquo;s road home lay for some distance in the same
direction as the old man&rsquo;s, and Comethup stood at the
gate for some moments, watching them going on together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
But the captain walked on one side of the pavement
and Brian swung along on the other, as far apart
as possible, and they did not appear to have anything to
say to each other.</p>

<p>After that, Brian Carlaw entered somewhat largely
into Comethup&rsquo;s existence, to the exclusion, at times, of
the captain. Comethup meant no disloyalty to his first
friend, and went to bed many a night troubled at the
thought that there was a breach growing between them;
but Brian, child though he was, had a fine air of appropriating
Comethup and planning excursions with him,
and arranging boyish expeditions from which the younger
child found it difficult to escape. He would dash in, in
the morning, with his eyes sparkling and his gay laugh
waking up the house, and drag Comethup off, waving
aside every remonstrance, and refusing to wait an instant
for anything. He had a splendid, reckless fashion, so
Comethup thought, of scorning mere ordinary doors and
paths, such as were used by mere ordinary boys, and of
leaping and rushing across flower-beds or turf, and climbing
in at a window, in a most unexpected and daring way.
One never knew quite where to have him, or what to expect
of him; one never knew quite in what mood he would
appear. And each mood was something different from
the last, and, whether grave or gay, wholly captivating.
If he came with some childish tale of tribulation on his
lips, it was a tribulation apparently so great and so real
that all one&rsquo;s heart went out to him and one could not do
enough to show how deep was one&rsquo;s sympathy; at least
that was what Comethup felt. If he dashed in, with
laughter on his lips and devilry in his eyes, the thing was
so infectious, so maddening, that even grave little Comethup
was bitten by it and felt the devil leaping in his
veins as well, and was ready for anything.</p>

<p>When it happened that the captain and Comethup met
at all, they met, curiously enough, although neither confessed
it to the other, by stealth. Brian monopolized the
younger boy so much that there were no more arranged
meetings, unless the one met the other by accident a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
before, and was able to suggest that a meeting should be
held. On most occasions, if Brian had not appeared by
a certain hour, Comethup would steal off to the captain&rsquo;s
cottage. Never a word would be said, but each fully
and completely understood the situation; and the captain
welcomed Comethup, and Comethup received the welcome,
with as much grave courtesy as though they had
been in the habit of meeting daily, and there were no outside
circumstances in their simple lives to separate them.
It was clearly understood on either hand that Brian was
elsewhere, or had failed to keep some engagement he had
made; and the captain very happily, and Comethup very
happily too, but feeling a little bit like a traitor to both
sides, would start off, hand in hand, to enjoy one of the
old days.</p>

<p>Yet, even on those occasions, so great was the influence
of the other boy upon them that they would keep a
wary eye open&mdash;still without a word to each other&mdash;for
his possible appearance on the scene. The building of the
forts was not the splendid, sole-absorbing thing it used
to be, because they did it stealthily. Some one else had
entered into their paradise, and had turned the fruit of it
a little sour. Comethup tried hard, on those occasions,
to be very, very good to the captain; and the captain,
for his part, tried hard to appear as though there could
be nothing different between them, and as though these
stolen days were just as nice and just as spontaneous as
the former days had been. But things were different,
somehow; their world went differently, and was not the
world they had known before. Comethup found his mind
wandering, even during the recital of a thrilling battle
episode, to that boy with the splendid eyes and the charming
manner, and found himself wondering what the boy
was doing, and if he carried little Comethup in his mind.</p>

<p>The expeditions with Brian were not of the innocent
and sober character which marked those with Captain
Garraway-Kyle; Brian was the leader, and was ready at
all times for something new; the very soul of the boy
seemed to cry out for that; a new discovery, fascinating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to-day, was old and tiresome to-morrow; the day was a
hopeless and fretful one that saw nothing new or fantastic
accomplished. His enterprise knew no bounds, and
fear, in the ordinary mortal sense, was not in him. The
captain&rsquo;s expeditions had been wonderful, and each had
furnished a new delight for Comethup; but they paled
into insignificance beside the inventions of Brian.</p>

<p>David Willis was a man of many dreamy occupations,
a man who never hurried, and whose life may be said to
have been filled with odds and ends of employment. So
it happened that Comethup came and went as he would,
and his father saw but little of him; he knew that the
child was happy, and he heard his voice frequently about
the house. But beyond that he cared nothing; he was
simply content to know that the child was there, and
that all was well with him. Thus Comethup had plenty
of scope for his adventures, and plenty of time for any
expedition that might present itself.</p>

<p>There was an old and half-ruined house which stood
on the extreme outskirts of the town and was surrounded
by an old, dark, neglected wilderness of a garden. The
two children had peeped in through the rusty iron gates
occasionally, with their small faces pressed close between
the bars, and had speculated upon what the garden contained
and who lived in the house. Brian stoutly asserted
that the house was empty, and then that it was
haunted; he had probably heard his father or the servants
say that. It remained, and had remained for some time,
the one possible place which they had not explored; Brian
would not have confessed it for the world, but he had
a deadly fear of it, probably the only fear he knew concerning
anything at that time. It frightened him, even
while it fascinated him; he would choose that way to
walk, even when it meant that to pass the house they
would have to go a long way out of the direction they
had arranged.</p>

<p>At last one day he came in, with his eyes curiously
bright, and announced his intention of exploring the
place. They would get in somehow, he said&mdash;through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
window if necessary. Comethup was doubtful, but
Brian&rsquo;s stronger will conquered, as usual, and they set
off. Near the place, however, the elder boy hesitated, and
drew back a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be
any fun in it.&rdquo; And he began to walk away.</p>

<p>Comethup felt relieved; he had not liked the expedition
from the first. He said nothing, but set out to follow
Brian.</p>

<p>But Brian chafed under a sense of degradation all
day. He watched Comethup sharply, to be sure that the
younger boy was not actually laughing at him; saw scorn
in his eyes, when there was no scorn in Comethup&rsquo;s heart.
They had parted for their midday meal, and had been
out again in the afternoon, still under that sense of constraint,
and Comethup was diligently studying the pictures
in an old book alone in the parlour of his father&rsquo;s
house, when Brian came leaping across the flower-beds
and cried to him from outside the window:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along; don&rsquo;t wait for anything. I&rsquo;m going to
that house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup knew perfectly well which house was meant,
but he affected ignorance, and said weakly, &ldquo;Which
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know; the haunted one; the one we didn&rsquo;t
go to to-day. Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup closed the book, but kept a finger between
the leaves. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very late,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;ll soon be
getting dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian stood with his hands on the window sill, impatiently
kicking at the house wall. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid,&rdquo; he
said, looking up at Comethup.</p>

<p>Comethup shook his head, but his drawn brows showed
anxiety. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;d rather wait until to-morrow, if you want to see the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one ever goes to a house that&rsquo;s haunted in the
daytime,&rdquo; said Brian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nicer in the daytime,&rdquo; urged Comethup, getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
one leg down from the window seat and dangling it irresolutely.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll come if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along then,&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so
slow; you can&rsquo;t make up your mind quickly, as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup knew that the reproach was justified, and
felt humbled accordingly. He was not altogether so
happy in this adventure as he had been in all those which
had preceded it. In the first place, he had to steal out
of the house into the mysterious summer evening, being
careful that no one saw him. His father was in church
practising; he could hear the slow droning of the organ,
like the hum of a gigantic tired insect going to sleep with
the rest of the world. Comethup wished that he had gone
into the church with his father, and sat there, out of the
way of temptation such as this.</p>

<p>The evening was warm and heavy, and a hundred sweet
odours came from the gardens which fringed the road.
Brian talked valiantly and loudly as they went along
of how foolish it was to be afraid of anything, just because
it happened to be dark, and of a hundred other matters
tending to keep up his ebbing courage. Comethup
was silent, doggedly determined to go through with the
business, now that he had embarked upon it, and with a
plaintive hope in his heart that it might not be so dreadful,
after all.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, that part of the outskirts of the
town in which the house lay seemed always to be darker
and more sombre-looking than any other. All the houses
about there were very old, with high walls and tall, rustling
old trees; with paths in their gardens which seemed
always full of dead leaves and weeds at all times of the
year. And that particular house was the most sombre
and dismal-looking of them all. It had originally been
a very fine house; there were the remains of carvings
on the stone pillars which supported the gates. But
everything was in decay; one of the great gates hung
merely by one hinge, and swayed perilously when it was
touched; the other stood permanently ajar.</p>

<p>Their young hearts were beating very heavily when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
they reached the gates. A wind had risen, and was coming
from the distant sea across the flat marshland; it
stirred the trees and bent their long limbs, so that they
seemed to point down at the two small, trembling figures,
and to ask who they were, and to plot and whisper against
them. Comethup and Brian gripped hands tightly as
they slipped through the aperture between the gates. The
wind seemed specially to haunt that place; it sent a dusty,
whirling eddy of last year&rsquo;s leaves charging at them and
fluttering about them as they went hesitatingly up the
long drive. Brian stopped halfway to the house and
pushed his cap back on his clustering hair with well-assumed
carelessness, and said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be
seen; I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll go any farther. Besides, we
ought to be home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup kept steadily on up the drive. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
up to the house,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>There was nothing left for Brian but to follow him,
which he did, keeping a wary eye behind him. They
gained confidence as they went on, and even raised their
voices a little above the whisper in which they had spoken
previously. They ploughed their way through the neglected
grounds where the paths were scarcely to be distinguished
for the mass of tangled weeds which overgrew
them, and came up to the house. Not a light showed
anywhere; the windows were all shuttered, and the doors
apparently fastened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any one lives here,&rdquo; said Brian, sinking
his voice again to a whisper. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think
we&rsquo;ll go in to-night; we&rsquo;ve seen a good deal, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup evidently thought that he had done sufficient
to clear him from that accusation of cowardice;
but, for the keeping up of appearances, he spoke with
apparent reluctance: &ldquo;Oh, if you like; perhaps we had
better go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The house behind them, standing up gray and stark
and sombre in the twilight, was a far more terrible thing
than it had been when they faced it. By common consent
they hurried a little as they trotted along among the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
leaves. The wind, too, was at their back now, and flung
fluttering things about their legs and against their ears;
they were afraid to look round, and yet afraid to go on
without glancing behind them. Halfway down the drive,
too, they heard a rustling among the trees, a louder rustling
than that caused by the wind. Brian stopped still,
and Comethup wondered why his heart kept jumping up
into his throat and nearly choking him. Then, from
among the shadows of the trees, came a little figure all in
white&mdash;a figure smaller even than Comethup, but very
terrible coming in that fashion, and in that hour and in
that place. At any other time they might have said it
was a little child, a girl; but now their nerves were too
unstrung for practical things. There could be no mistake
about its identity. With a sort of simultaneous gasp they
set off at headlong speed down the drive, straight for the
gate.</p>

<p>And the figure came running after them, crying something
piteously to them. But that was worse than anything
else; they almost tumbled over each other in their
eagerness to get out through the gates; in fact, they never
stopped running till they were far down the road, and
breathless. Then Brian leaned against a wall and surveyed
Comethup with horror-struck eyes. &ldquo;It was the
ghost!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and it ran after us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Comethup, slowly, and a little doubtfully,
&ldquo;it was the ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it was pretty big, too,&rdquo; said Brian, fanning himself
with his cap. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t look so large in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup lay awake a long time that night in his little
room under the roof. He was not frightened; he was
quite calm as he looked out through the uncurtained window
at the blinking stars. He seemed to set everything
else aside, and to hear only the piteous, pleading voice
crying to him in the garden; he was quite sorry now that
he had run away; and very, very sorry, in his childish
mind, for the ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a very little ghost,&rdquo; he murmured to himself
as he fell asleep.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="subheading">THE CAPTAIN PLAYS THE KNIGHT-ERRANT.</p>


<p>Comethup saw nothing of Brian for two days after
that, and, although he seized the opportunity of making
amends to the captain, he said nothing of the adventure
to that gentleman. Indeed, Comethup had been haunted by
the ghost he had seen, in quite a different sense from that
which might have been expected, and the captain seemed
altogether unequal to the occasion. He could think of
nothing else; was, indeed, so desperately sorry for that
lonely little ghost that it lost the terrors it might otherwise
have had for him, and melted his heart with pity for
its dreadful fate. He lay awake at night, thinking of it
in that garden of shadows and decay, wandering alone
among the trees, and always with that appealing cry upon
its lips. He tried, in a subtle fashion, to put leading
questions to the captain, in an endeavour to discover
something of the condition of ghosts in general, and little
ones in particular; but the captain, being of an eminently
practical turn of mind, dismissed the subject curtly
enough. So Comethup was thrown on his own resources.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day, after he had left the
captain at the gate, and had saluted him in the fashion
they always adopted when Brian was not present, Comethup
felt that he could stand this state of uncertainty
no longer. He remembered that the captain had once
told him that a brave man never shrinks from anything
that will help his fellows&mdash;a wise and beautiful thing,
which Comethup had not forgotten; and surely a ghost,
and such a little one, was one of his fellows. Comethup
was not quite certain what a ghost was, or what position
in the scheme of things it really occupied; but, with that
dogged determination which lay behind all the gentleness
of his character, he determined, in his simple way, that he
could not sleep in his warm and sweet-smelling bed another
night while the ghost wandered crying about that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
desolate garden. With a horrible fear tugging at his
heart, and yet with a childish courage urging him on
which was greater and stronger than the fear, he took his
cap and stole out of the house, and ran as fast as his
legs would carry him to the house he had visited with
Brian.</p>

<p>It was terrible work getting through that gate; and
in the long drive where the shadows were it was more
terrible still. But he went on slowly, with his hands
spread out as if to feel his way, and with his eyes, very
bright and very wide open, peering into the darkness.
He coughed, and hummed a tune, but dared not look behind
him; the desperate business had been begun, and
Comethup Willis, trembling in every limb, had yet fully
made up his mind to see the ghost before he passed again
out of the gate, if it were to be seen.</p>

<p>He saw it at last, much nearer the house than it had
been before. It came toward him, more and more slowly
as the distance between them lessened. Comethup backed
away a little; but it suddenly stretched out hands to him,
and came forward at a run, so that there was no chance
of escape. And then the horror of the thing, the tense
fear that had been knocking at his heart, fell away from
him in a moment. For he touched warm hands of flesh,
and saw that it was a child of about his own age, looking
wonderingly at him. Poor Comethup almost laughed
with the sudden relief, and they remained for a moment
after their hands had dropped away from each other&rsquo;s,
looking into each other&rsquo;s faces shyly, as children do at a
first meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; said Comethup at last. &ldquo;I thought
you were a ghost. Where do you come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child stretched out an arm, and pointed to the
house. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with father.&rdquo; She spoke in
a whisper&mdash;the whisper of a person long subdued, and used
to the sound only of her own voice. She was very pretty,
with big, dark eyes, and a very white skin; but there was
an elfish, frightened manner about her that had nothing
of childhood in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But the house is all shut up,&rdquo; urged Comethup.
&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t your father open the shutters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All those rooms are empty,&rdquo; said the child; &ldquo;they
frighten you to go in them, because you make such a
noise, and the eyes in the shutters stare at you. We live
right round the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s such a dreadful place,&rdquo; said Comethup, compassionately,
looking from the bright, eager face of the
child to the desolate garden. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you very lonely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child nodded and looked about her, and drew instinctively
a little nearer to the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t any one come to see you?&rdquo; asked Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only Mrs. Blissett, in the morning. Mrs. Blissett
makes the beds, and gives me my breakfast and my dinner;
then she comes again when it&rsquo;s dark, and puts me to
bed. And she grumbles all the time, and keeps on asking
what the Lord made brats for. That&rsquo;s me, you know,&rdquo;
she added, innocently.</p>

<p>Comethup looked properly sympathetic, and asked,
&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Linda. I think it&rsquo;s a longer name than that, but
father calls me &rsquo;Linda. What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup got it out trippingly; it was always a difficult
matter, in those early years, to get the uncouth
thing off his tongue. The girl looked puzzled, and begged
him to repeat it; he did so, with a flush upon his face.
He was already beginning to understand, by the surprise
with which the name was always received, that there was
something remarkable and even ridiculous about it. But
this girl apparently liked it; laughed softly and turned
it over on her tongue, and said &ldquo;Comethup,&rdquo; with a little
break in the middle of it; &ldquo;yes, it&rsquo;s a pretty name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup was gratified, and had a sudden wish that
he had paid her the same compliment. They stood awkwardly
and shyly looking at each other, until the slow,
heavy steps of some one trudging through the dead leaves
bestirred them to a recollection of time and place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mrs. Blissett,&rdquo; said the child with a sigh,
&ldquo;and I shall have go to bed. Come back here where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
she won&rsquo;t see you. Can&rsquo;t you hear her coming, and
grumbling to herself all the way?&rdquo; The question ended
with a little ripple of laughter, and Comethup, glancing at
the child, saw all her white teeth showing in a smile, and
her eyes dancing with it. She drew him back among the
shadows of the trees while the heavy-footed, murmuring
Mrs. Blissett pounded solemnly along toward the house.
They stood quite still, until the footsteps had died away,
and then, to Comethup&rsquo;s great surprise and consternation,
this small girl-child caught him by his jacket, kissed him
swiftly, and cried in a breath: &ldquo;Good-night, Comethup;
come and see me to-morrow,&rdquo; and sped away from him
through the trees.</p>

<p>Comethup stood, in a dazed condition, looking after
her for some moments, and softly rubbing his cheek with
one hand where her lips had touched him; and then, with
very mixed emotions, set off for home. But though the
garden was the same, and though the wind whispered
through the trees, and the dead leaves drove at him, it
had no further terrors for him; had, indeed, become a
place of wonder and delight, as everything else seemed
to become in his small world. His father, his little room
at home, his mother&rsquo;s sleeping place among the green
mounds in the churchyard, the captain and the building
of the forts, Brian and his reckless expeditions&mdash;all these
were things of delight to the boy. And now, in the midst
of them, had sprung up a new wonder, growing beautifully
in the midst of the terrors which had seemed to be about
her. He went home with a fast-beating heart, full of his
new discovery, and anxious to unbosom himself regarding
it to some one of sympathy.</p>

<p>He was never quite sure of his father; he loved him
very dearly, and thought his soft voice and the quiet, caressing
words he used better than all the music he played
in the church. But his father had a dreamy way of looking
over him, or right through him, when some question
of moment was being discussed; of losing himself suddenly
in the maze of his thoughts, and wandering off
somewhere where Comethup could not follow him. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
that Comethup often hesitated about giving a confidence
to him, because he feared, in his sensitive little soul, that
his father might not follow it out&mdash;whatever it might be&mdash;patiently
to the end, as it should be followed; might forget
what the all-important subject was before the tale
had half been told. He hesitated now, and was obliged
to confess, sitting up in bed in the moonlight, with his
hands clasped round his linen-covered knees, that his
father might not understand, and might&mdash;worst thought
of all&mdash;look dreamily at him, and stroke his hair, and
say, with a maddening smile: &ldquo;Yes, yes, my boy. Of
course; just so,&rdquo; and begin to hum an air from some of
his beloved music and straightway forget all else. It was
quite certain that it was impossible for him to tell his
father.</p>

<p>Brian, perhaps, had a right to know; Brian had been
in the garden with him, and still believed that the garden
held a ghost. But Comethup shrank more strongly still
from the idea of telling his cousin; shook his head very
decidedly in the moonlight when he thought of it. It
may have been purely a matter of instinct, probably was;
but in his childish mind that garden, with its dim shadows
and its quaint little figure whose kiss still seemed
hot upon his cheek, was a fairyland into which he jealously
desired to go alone, and in which Brian, in the
imagination, seemed an uncouth figure.</p>

<p>The list of possible sympathizers was narrowing down;
there remained only the captain; and slowly there grew
in Comethup&rsquo;s mind the idea that the captain was, after
all, the right person. The boy acted over to himself a
little interview, in which he seemed to know, with exactitude,
what the captain would say and what the captain
would do; was sure of him, so to speak, from the
outset. For, in Comethup&rsquo;s mind, the captain might be
abrupt and might be severe; but his rules of conduct were
such that, if followed, a small boy would sleep soundly
in his bed at night, and would not fear the darkness. So
he decided to tell the captain, and, comforted with the
thought, fell asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>The opportunity occurred the very next day. Comethup
went to tea with the captain, firmly resolved to unbosom
himself about the whole matter. But he let the
precious moments slip by, and talked of everything else
under the sun, and tried to appear interested in all that
the captain said, while his mind was leaping back to that
desolate garden and to the little figure wandering alone
in it. He remembered, too, with a sudden hot sensation
of shame, that the child had cried, &ldquo;Come again to-morrow!&rdquo;
and here was to-morrow. Yet he sat there, saying
never a word of what filled his mind, until the moment
arrived when it was necessary for him to return home.
For the captain was punctual in all things, and Comethup
arrived at the house at an exact hour, and left it at another
equally rigidly defined.</p>

<p>Comethup got as far as the doorstep before he made
up his mind to say anything; and then, as he brought his
hand down from the salute, he said hurriedly, &ldquo;I&mdash;I
wanted to speak to you&mdash;about something&mdash;sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain looked down at the small figure gravely.
&ldquo;Important?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Comethup felt his courage oozing. &ldquo;Not&mdash;not very,&rdquo;
he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep it till to-morrow,&rdquo; said the captain, nodding at
him. &ldquo;No time now, you know. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup saluted again, and went miserably away.
He returned home, and sat for a long time at the window,
thinking about the child. He had not promised that he
would go again to see her; but it had seemed like a promise,
and he could not bear the thought that she might be
waiting there, with her great, dark, eager eyes straining
toward the gate, looking for him. It was the first time
that any real or definite sorrow had touched his life&mdash;the
first time that any living thing had seemed dependent
on him for happiness. With the captain it was different;
it was impossible for Comethup&rsquo;s mind to grasp the idea
that he was all-important in the captain&rsquo;s bare existence;
that the captain watched for him, day after day, and felt
his old heart jump a little as the boy swung up the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
path, as he might have felt it jump, in years gone by, at
the coming of a woman. Comethup did not understand
that; he saw only in the captain&rsquo;s kindness and patronage
of himself a very great and sweet graciousness, a something
that the captain went out of his way to do, because
he was very kind and very great. Comethup adored the
captain, but he did not know that the captain would have
willingly consented to be pierced through and through
with his own old sword hanging over the dim little looking-glass
in his cottage parlour, if he could thereby have
served Comethup.</p>

<p>The hunger at Comethup&rsquo;s heart grew stronger as the
evening wore on. A wind had sprung up, bringing with
it some gusts of rain, and flinging little splashes on to
Comethup&rsquo;s face as he sat with his chin in his hands at
the open window. At last, heedless of wind or rain, he
caught up his cap, and set off at a run for the captain&rsquo;s
house.</p>

<p>The captain was pacing up and down the little parlour,
turning abruptly on his heel when he reached the
edge of the hearthrug, and again when he almost breasted
the old oak bureau at the other side of the room. Seeing
the boy standing panting and white-faced in the doorway
with his cap in his hand, the captain stopped dead, and
faced him. Comethup was trembling so much that he
even forgot to salute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; he burst out, almost on the verge of tears.
&ldquo;The little girl&mdash;I thought she was a ghost&mdash;in the garden&mdash;and
it&rsquo;s raining&mdash;and I promised to go and see her&mdash;and
I haven&rsquo;t been&mdash;and Mrs. Blissett says she&rsquo;s a brat,
and&mdash;oh, sir&mdash;what am I to do?&rdquo; And poor Comethup
burst into tears and hid his face in the lining of his cap.</p>

<p>It may naturally be supposed that the captain was
startled. The first idea he grasped, however, was that the
boy was in distress, and that was sufficient to stir him to
action; he put his arm tenderly round Comethup&rsquo;s shoulders,
stooping a little and trying to draw the cap away
from his face, and led him over to a chair. There, seating
himself, he drew the boy against his knee, saying nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
but gripping him tightly with his arm, so that the very
presence of that comforting, encircling thing should make
itself felt without the necessity for words. In a few moments
Comethup was calmer, and could give an intelligent
account of what he wanted.</p>

<p>The captain questioned him closely, and Comethup
knew whether or not he was pleased, at each point of
the recital, by the tightening or loosening of the arm
about him. When he had finished, and had expressed his
determination to go to the house and see the child, the
arm held him very closely indeed.</p>

<p>For some moments the captain sat perfectly still; then
he got up, walked across to the window, and looked
out. Darkness had already fallen, and the wind and rain
were making havoc among the captain&rsquo;s roses. It was
characteristic of the captain that he took the whole matter
from the boy&rsquo;s standpoint; never appeared to consider
for an instant that he might be interfering in some one
else&rsquo;s business. He saw only, as Comethup had done, the
child alone in the garden, haunted by fears of the echoing,
half-empty house, and of Mrs. Blissett. Finally, with
a grunt, he turned sharply away from the window,
walked across the room to a long cupboard, and pulled
open its double doors with a jerk; then he pulled out from
it a long, old-fashioned military cloak, very rusty and
faded, and swung it round his shoulders with a single
movement of his arm. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go and find her, boy,&rdquo; he
said, and Comethup followed him obediently from the
room.</p>

<p>The captain took down his hat from the peg in the
hall and rammed it on his head a little more tightly than
usual, and opened the cottage door. A drifting spray of
rain drove in at them, and the captain threw out a fold
of his cloak, like a huge wing, and drew it round the boy.
Then they passed out of the cottage together.</p>

<p>Comethup had only a dim remembrance afterward of
that walk; of passing people in the streets, and seeing
only their feet and ankles; of hearing everything muffled
and blurred through the heavy cloak; of catching glimpses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
of a storm-twisted sky through certain tiny moth-holes
and thinnesses of the cloak as it touched his face. Presently
the captain threw back an edge of it, and Comethup
saw that they were standing before the iron gates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go first,&rdquo; said the captain, in a low voice, &ldquo;and call
to her. Don&rsquo;t frighten her if she is there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Comethup stepped softly into the garden, treading
cautiously over the wet leaves, and feeling the heavy
rain drops from the branches above him tumbling on his
hair and shoulders. He called &ldquo;&rsquo;Linda! &rsquo;Linda!&rdquo; as he
went.</p>

<p>Out of the darkness near the house came the little
figure at last, as he had hoped; not joyfully, or with
laughter on its lips, but bedraggled, and wet, and trembling,
and piteous. She ran to him and caught him
eagerly, whispering his name brokenly between her sobs,
and hiding her tear-stained face against his childish shoulder.
She did not see the captain, who stood with his
arms folded beneath his military cloak, looking down at
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Linda, dear,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;you are all wet. Don&rsquo;t
shake so; nothing can hurt you. And here&rsquo;s my friend
the captain; he&rsquo;s a soldier, you know, and fights people.&rdquo;
This last as a reassurance to the child that she had powerful
friends indeed.</p>

<p>The girl looked up at the captain, looked at him for a
long moment in silence. Comethup, turning about, saw
that the captain had thrown back his cloak and had
dropped on one knee, and was holding out his long, thin
old arms toward the child; the cloak fell all about him
like a tent. She scarcely seemed to hesitate a moment,
but went within the shelter of the tent, and was drawn
close there, with the captain&rsquo;s head bent above her.
Comethup was so surprised that he did not even think
how the captain would be spoiling the knee of his trousers
in the wet grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little maid, little maid,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;what
brings you out here in this dreadful place alone? Is
there no one to care for you, poor baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I came out to see&mdash;Comethup,&rdquo; said the child, getting
over the name with difficulty, &ldquo;and Mrs. Blissett
saw me and said I should stop here in the dark, and
banged the door and went in. I &rsquo;spects she&rsquo;s forgotten
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain murmured something concerning Mrs.
Blissett behind his heavy mustache, and suddenly gathered
the child up in his arms and rose to his feet. And
when he spoke, although his voice was very gentle, it
was very determined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your father, baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s writing, and talking to himself,&rdquo; replied the
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to him,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Which way do
I go&mdash;round here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child told him the way, and he marched steadily
through the wet leaves and the long grass, with Comethup
following him, until he came to a door. Still holding the
child in his arms, he began vigorously to kick at the
door, flinging his foot at it at regular intervals like musket-shots.
A sharp and querulous voice replied suddenly
from the other side:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay where ye be, ye brat! I bean&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to &rsquo;ave
ye runnin&rsquo; in and out just as ye likes. And stop a-kickin&rsquo;
that door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open the door!&rdquo; cried the captain, in a very loud
voice.</p>

<p>There was a shuffling of feet on the other side, and
the door was pulled open. A candle had been set down
on some bare, uncarpeted stairs near at hand, and was
flaring in the wind; a heavy, surprised-looking country-woman
stood in the doorway, looking out at the little
group.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you Mrs. Blissett?&rdquo; asked the captain, rapping
out the words fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I be,&rdquo; said the woman, hurriedly bending
herself at the knees, in a sort of staggering courtesy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what the devil do you mean by putting this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
baby out in the rain?&rdquo; exclaimed the captain. &ldquo;Stand
aside, and let me in. Where&rsquo;s your master!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman was at first too startled to reply; she
backed against the wall, and waved one hand feebly toward
the stairs. The captain nodded at the candle, and
the woman, with her eyes blinking nervously, groped for
it, picked it up, and backed away with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go first,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;and tell your master
that a gentleman wishes to see him.&mdash;Comethup, follow
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman hesitated for a moment, and then went
before them heavily up the stairs with the candle. The
door leading into the garden remained open, and Comethup
felt the wet wind blowing about his legs as he followed
the captain, who marched steadily close behind the
woman. The child had stolen an arm up round the captain&rsquo;s
neck, under his cloak; and he was holding her
against his breast with one arm, while his tall old silk
hat, dripping with rain, swung in his disengaged hand.</p>

<p>At the top of the first flight of stairs the woman
stopped at a door and bent her head as though listening,
and then rapped with her knuckles. After a moment or
two, receiving no answer, she turned the handle and went
hesitatingly in, the captain following her closely, and
Comethup hard on the heels of the captain.</p>

<p>The room in which they found themselves was so very
dark that for a moment those unused to it would not have
noticed that it had any light in it at all, or any occupant.
But, far away in one corner of it, Comethup saw a little
round gleam of light, which reminded him of the gleam
of lanterns he had seen men carry on country roads on
winter nights, and, close beside the gleam, watching them
intently and frowningly, a face. Even before the lips
parted, and the harsh voice spoke, Comethup had that
face indelibly impressed upon his mind, to haunt him long
afterward, in its curious detached circle of light, while
he lay in his bed under his father&rsquo;s roof.</p>

<p>It was a stern, strong, forbidding face&mdash;a face of hard
lines and straight firmnesses, without a single tender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
curve or hollow about it, to proclaim that there was any
softness in the man to whom it belonged. The patch of
light showed a great, high forehead, from which the hair
had long been pushed back and pushed off by impatient
hands; beneath this, straight black eyebrows almost meeting,
and, under them, eyes as cold and piercing as steel
in moonlight. The man, as he sat, was literally hemmed
in by books; as the light of the candle carried by Mrs.
Blissett penetrated farther through the shadows, Comethup
saw that there were piles of books all about his feet,
and about the legs of the desk at which he sat; the desk
itself was loaded with them, and staggering heaps of them
leaned against the wall and perched perilously on chairs
and other articles of furniture. In the silence which followed
their entry, while the man looked at them from
beside his little shaded reading-lamp, Comethup could
distinctly hear the heavy, agitated breathing of Mrs.
Blissett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s this, what&rsquo;s this? What has happened?
What do you all want? Can&rsquo;t you speak? Is the house
on fire?&rdquo; All these questions were rapidly jerked out
in harsh, impatient tones, with a little querulous note at
the end of each, like the fretful tones of a child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blissett was eagerly commencing a voluble reply
which should excuse her own delinquencies, when the
captain stepped forward, with the child still easily resting
on his arm, bent his head stiffly and spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I ask your pardon for intruding at such an
hour, but I am a blunt man, trained all my life to prompt
action. I found this mite&mdash;this baby&mdash;wandering in
the grounds outside this house, drenched to the skin, and
crying as it hurts a man to hear a child cry. I understood
that she lived here, and had been shut out in the
rain by this woman&rdquo; (the captain indicated the trembling
Mrs. Blissett with a jerk of his head). &ldquo;So I
brought her in.&rdquo; The captain stepped forward a little,
and uncovered the face of the child; she was sleeping
peacefully, with her head against his breast.</p>

<p>The man did not reply; he got up abruptly from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
desk, kicking over some of the piles of books about his
feet as he moved, and began striding up and down that
end of the room, with something of the appearance of a
hunted animal, turning his face furtively toward them as
he turned in his walk, yet keeping always at the greatest
possible distance away. As he came to the desk once or
twice, and fumbled nervously among the papers and books
upon it, Comethup was able to see that his dress was
very unkempt and shabby, and stained as a man might
stain it who read during hurriedly snatched meals, and
was careless how he ate. He spoke at last, in the same
querulous voice; he spoke like a man labouring under the
lash of some secret trouble, and yet desirous of putting
himself right with the world. These people might have
been sternly arrayed against him, so strongly and petulantly
did he offer his excuses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you, sir; I have no desire to know you.
There is an old adage which says something about fools
stepping in where angels fear to tread. What if the child
was in the rain? What if every living creature that bears
the brand of her sex wandered homeless and outcast to-night?
Would the world be the poorer? Would any single
thing that affects its progress, or its virtue, or its beauty,
if you will have it so, be changed or stand still? This
woman&rdquo;&mdash;he fiercely indicated Mrs. Blissett&mdash;&ldquo;was given
a certain duty, and, like all of her class, having received
payment for it, she neglects to perform it. Don&rsquo;t you
know enough of the world yet, or where have you been
living all your days, that you don&rsquo;t know that?&rdquo; Then,
with a certain sudden jealousy, he made a movement toward
the captain, and asked, &ldquo;What do you want with
the child? How does she concern you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s arm tightened a little round the sleeping
child. &ldquo;I do you the justice to suppose, sir, that,
in spite of what you have said, even you would not
leave a baby out of doors on such a night as this,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, who said I should? But there are more
important things in the world than children; I have work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
to do here, and have no time to give to the guardianship
of babies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is your child?&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I have already
heard how the mite wanders round this place at
night, lonely and neglected. Is there no one to care for
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man laughed, in a curious, hard fashion, and
looked straight at the captain. &ldquo;No, no one,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Really, sir, you take a great deal upon yourself. You
trespass on my property, and you interfere with my domestic
affairs. Is there anything else about which you
would care to make an inquiry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sarcastic note was lost on the captain; he answered
bluntly and simply, as was his habit:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am an old and a very lonely man, sir, and, although
I was brought up to the profession of a soldier, I have
thought sometimes that I am not altogether fitted for it.
I have some tenderness of heart still left in me, and I
could not have slept in my bed to-night with the knowledge
that this child was neglected and unhappy. I have
no desire to interfere in any business which does not
concern me; but it must occur to you that it is a strange
life for a child to be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the fault of that is not mine,&rdquo;, said the man,
swinging about suddenly and facing the captain. &ldquo;She&mdash;she
has no mother, and I am occupied with&mdash;with other
things. You&mdash;you should not trouble; what can <i>I</i> do?&rdquo;
He spoke like a fretful child, walked to his desk, and
began turning over the leaves of a book.</p>

<p>The captain was puzzled; saw no prospect, with such
a creature as this, of making him understand the responsibilities
of a parent. He turned to Mrs. Blissett and
put the child in her arms, and said with some sternness:
&ldquo;Take her away, and warm and dry her, and put her to
bed. And be tender with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Blissett vanished hurriedly with ejaculations of
&ldquo;My precious! The dear lamb!&rdquo; and the like, and the
captain faced the father once more. That gentleman,
now that the chief object of the disturbance was gone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
seemed only anxious to be rid of his visitor; he seated
himself at his desk, and appeared to be busied with his
books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said the captain stiffly, &ldquo;after this intrusion
I ought to give you my name. I am Captain Garraway-Kyle,
at present living in this town, and I beg you
to believe that my intrusion here to-night was with the
best possible motives. I assure you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I quite understand,&rdquo; exclaimed the petulant
voice of the other. &ldquo;And my name is Vernier&mdash;Doctor
Vernier; you may have heard of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;I regret that I have not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Good-night!&rdquo; Dr. Vernier&rsquo;s head was down
among his books, so that, by the glow of the lamp, they
could only see the top of it. But the captain had not
finished yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for the little child, and for her loneliness,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and if I might be permitted&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hard face glanced up for a moment and the brows
were drawn together in a straight dark line. &ldquo;Thank
you; I desire no one to assist me in the management of
my house. Once more&mdash;good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain bowed stiffly, turned on his heel, and
walked out of the room, followed by Comethup, whose
presence the doctor had not even appeared to notice.
They found their way out of the dark house, and through
the garden into the road. There the captain stood upright
for a moment, thinking deeply, and then looked
down at Comethup. &ldquo;Comethup,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t be
put off like this, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must go and see her again, and&mdash;and look after
her, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>They solemnly shook hands on that decision, the captain
bending a little to perform the operation, and then
walked away homeward.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="subheading">TELLS OF AN ERRING WOMAN.</p>


<p>While the captain and Comethup were trudging steadily
homeward through the rain, the man in the dull upstairs
room sat within his circle of light, trying to fix
his mind upon the work before him. He held his broad
forehead between his palms, and set his lips, and bent his
eyes steadily upon the printed page, tapping out a little
impatient measure with his foot, in anger with himself
that he could not concentrate his attention. Finally, he
got up impatiently, kicking the books out of his path,
and began to stride up and down that end of the room,
having something again of the appearance of a hunted,
animal trotting to and fro within the measure of its
cage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I such a brute?&rdquo; he asked at last; &ldquo;are there
no days behind these&mdash;far away in the background&mdash;when
things were better and fairer, and when I dreamed a
dream, as other men have dreamed, of something greater
even than books? It was all lies, lies, lies! The man
who hugs a woman to his breast can only hold her safely
if he pays the price, and knits her to him with chains of
gold, forged tightly. His fleshly arms are never strong
enough; she will slip out of them; all the tales of woman&rsquo;s
constancy and woman&rsquo;s virtue have no word of truth in
them; the women were virtuous because their lack of virtue
was never discovered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began to pace up and down again, locking his
hands behind him, and alternately clasping them behind
his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I care?&rdquo; he began again, restlessly.
&ldquo;There is a fate in all these things, and if the fate
means that this child shall grow up, and live, and cheat
another man, why, then the fate must do its work, and
nothing that I can say will change it. I have had it in
my mind sometimes to pray&mdash;if any prayers could avail&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the child might die; that&rsquo;s one of the mysteries of
this strange creation of ours, that so fair and sweet a
thing should grow up, to foul men&rsquo;s ways, and spoil their
work. I wonder if I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the abrupt entry of Mrs. Blissett.
That worthy woman appeared altogether demoralized,
shaken to her prosaic depths; she came in panting,
with one hand pressed to her ample bosom. The man
stopped in his walk and turned savagely upon her, although
without speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, there&rsquo;s a lady, sir, as do be come to see
ye; and she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Vernier, with an angry exclamation, took a stride
toward her, but stopped suddenly. There was a shadow
behind the woman&mdash;the shadow of some one else, creeping
into the room with a hand against the wall as though
groping blindly. The man had seen it, and stood, like one
turned to stone, watching it. Mrs. Blissett, following the
direction of his eyes, turned swiftly, and backed away
from it. The figure, still with a hand against the wall,
came slowly along the side of the room, with her eyes fixed
only on him. He seemed to recover himself at last with
a start, drew a deep breath, and waved Mrs. Blissett from
the room with an impatient arm. &ldquo;You need not stay&mdash;you
need not stay. I will see the lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Blissett evidently had a vague idea that this
was a night when anything might happen; she had performed
her small duties about the place for many months,
and had never seen a living creature come to the house,
and on this night the place had already been twice invaded.
She backed out of the room with a sigh of resignation
and closed the door.</p>

<p>The stranger had put an arm across her eyes, as though
to shield herself from the doctor&rsquo;s gaze, and was leaning
against the wall; she seemed, from the shaking of her
slight body, to be weeping. There was silence between
them for some moments&mdash;a silence which the man broke;
his voice sounded strained and unnatural.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A long way&mdash;a very long way,&rdquo; replied the woman
without uncovering her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why have you come back here?&rdquo; His voice was
dull and level and hard, and his face might have been
cut out of stone, for any changing expression it wore.
&ldquo;You chose your own path; why have you abandoned it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was weeping so bitterly that for a time she could
not answer his question. At last she turned her face fully
to him, a young and rather pretty face, but haggard and
wild with weeping and with sorrow; he looked at it unmoved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been seeking for you a long time,&rdquo; she said
at last, in a voice scarcely above a whisper. &ldquo;There has
been a hunger here&rdquo;&mdash;she struck herself relentlessly on
the breast&mdash;&ldquo;greater than I could bear. I could not
sleep; I have even prayed to die. I want to see&mdash;to see
the child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man raised his arm fiercely, as though to ward
off her approach, and took a step backward. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he
cried, almost in a shout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask nothing else,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;If anything could
have held me true to the old life&mdash;if anything could
have bent me to your will, and starved the soul out of
me, it would have been the child. I tell you something
has gone out of me here&rdquo;&mdash;she struck herself again&mdash;&ldquo;and
I shall die if I can not hold her in my arms again.
You are a man; you do not understand. You can find it
in your heart to laugh at me, because I was able to leave
her; but she is flesh of my flesh, and I can not tear her
from me. Let me see her; let me know that she is well;
let me see her smile into my eyes again; let me kiss her!
Man, hear the rain and the wind; I have come through
them these many weary miles, and I will go through them
again. Let me see her, if only for a few minutes, and
I swear to you, by the God that gave her to me, that I
will go away, and trouble you no more! Only let me
ease my hunger.&rdquo; She was down on her knees at his
feet, stretching out her hands to clasp them; he backed
away to avoid her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not think of all this before,&rdquo; he said, slowly.
&ldquo;Where is the man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I thought so; I should scarcely have seen you
here again had he been alive. And what do you think is
to become of you now?&rdquo; He asked the question with
the bitter savagery of one who sees something that has
wronged him in the dust at his feet, helpless, and is
gladdened by the sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It does not matter; can&rsquo;t
you understand that nothing matters? But my child, my
baby; that has been the bitter thing through all. Do you
think that I would plead to you as I do now for anything
else? Do you think that I would kneel at your feet in any
other cause?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man began to pace up and down the room again,
grasping his strong, square chin by one hand, and bending
his brows in thought. The woman drew herself slowly
to her feet and watched him intently. After a moment
the man faced about, leaned his back against the wall,
folded his arms, and looked down at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hysterics, or appeals, or tears are useless in a matter
of this kind,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;let us look at it clearly
and dispassionately, as though it lay outside ourselves.
You have no right here; your part in my life and in the
child&rsquo;s is played out and done with&mdash;do you understand
that? You cut yourself off from it all long ago; I have
set myself to forget your very name, and I do not suppose
that the child can remember you. From the standpoint
of justice and morality, you have simply ceased to exist;
you&rsquo;re outside the pale&mdash;a lost, abandoned woman. Do
you understand <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman did not answer; she stood rocking herself
to and fro, like a creature in pain, with her hands pressed
tightly to her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I married you,&rdquo; the man went on, &ldquo;I gave you
everything that a woman could desire&mdash;money, culture, a
home. No thinking woman wants more than that. You
chose to tell me that the life you led was dull and spiritless;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
that I was always with my books; that my friends
did not interest you, and that you found their conversation
tedious. I think once&mdash;it&rsquo;s an old forgotten thing,
and I&rsquo;m not quite sure about it&mdash;but I think once you
told me that you had hoped for something else; I believe
you said some foolish schoolgirl nonsense about love.
Well, I gave you all I had to offer, and I fail to see how
any reasonable woman could ask for more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you never would understand that,&rdquo; she murmured
behind her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you made the acquaintance of this other man,
a ne&rsquo;er-do-weel, a child laughing in the sunshine, with no
purpose in his life and no character in his face. But,&rdquo;
he went on, sneeringly, &ldquo;he was the pretty, empty-headed
fool you wanted; he could quote rhymes to you, and fill
your ears with things that had no substance in them&mdash;things
such as every man has whispered to the woman he
craves since the world first began. Well, you believed
him; you caught at the shadow, and lost the substance.
Now he&rsquo;s dead, you think you can come back here, as
though nothing had happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not; I only want to see my baby. Give me but
an hour with her; let me assure myself that she is well;
let me see her only in her sleep if you will. I must see
her; this hunger at my heart will drive me mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has not driven you mad before,&rdquo; he said, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I tried to forget; <i>he</i> made me forget. Oh, don&rsquo;t
you understand that a woman may be righteous even in
her sin; that she may cling to a man sinfully sometimes,
just because she has promised? It is too late in the day
now for us to blame each other, or for me to attempt to
justify myself. Only believe that I have left all that old
unhappiness behind. John, you will let me see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you find out where I was?&rdquo; asked the man,
after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to the old home and found that you had left.
I made fruitless inquiries for a long time, and at last,
quite by accident, happened upon some one who had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
you in this town. I came here yesterday and got a quiet
lodging, and set about to look for you. Indeed&rdquo;&mdash;as the
man made an impatient gesture&mdash;&ldquo;indeed, I have not
come to trouble you again; I will go away, and you shall
not see me any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man appeared to be thinking deeply. After a long
pause, during which she looked at him appealingly, with
her hands tightly clasped, he spoke, going first to the
door, and assuring himself that it was shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I left the home you dishonoured and abandoned,&rdquo;
he began, &ldquo;I dismissed the servants and brought
the child with me, and came here secretly. I had some
pride, more perhaps than you imagined, and I did not
want the stupid story bandied about on every one&rsquo;s lips.
I determined to set aside that mistake and begin over
again. So I chose this old house, in a town where no
one knew me; I got a woman to come in, day by day, to
do what little work there was to be done, and to
look after the child. It&rsquo;s a dreary place,&rdquo; he said, looking
round the darkened room with a sigh, &ldquo;but the
child has to suffer, I suppose, for the sins of the mother;
that&rsquo;s an inevitable law. It&rsquo;s an inevitable law also that
punishment follows sin&mdash;not in the next world only, if
there be one, but here. I should be wanting in something,
failing to carry out what I have so often preached
and written, if I did not recognise that punishment must
follow your sin, and that you&mdash;poor frail mortal that you
are&mdash;have inevitably and unconsciously rushed upon your
own punishment. It shall be a fine and a bitter one, I
promise you. Listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up at him tremblingly, striving to read in
his inscrutable face the meaning of his words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not only see the child for an hour; you
shall live here, in the same house with it, as long as you
like.&rdquo; Then, as she would have cried out, he put up one
hand to stop her, and laughed, and went on mercilessly:
&ldquo;But on one condition. I have told you that no one here
knows anything of my story; they believe, I think, that
the mother of the child is dead. Let them still think so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
The condition I impose is that you shall remain in this
house, under the name by which I first knew you; that
you shall occupy the position of housekeeper; that you
shall see the child, and attend to her wants in every way,
and at any time you like. I have discovered to-night
that she has been somewhat neglected by the person I
paid to look after her; you will have a deeper interest in
her than that, and may be trusted, I think, to look after
her well.&rdquo; He laughed again, then suddenly stepped
across to her and took her fiercely by the arms and
looked into her eyes. &ldquo;But understand this: She is to
know nothing of the relationship that exists between you;
she will know you only as a paid dependent. The instant
that, from any endearment you give her, or any word
you let slip, she learns that you are her mother, you leave
this place, and see her no more! Do you understand
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shrank away from him and covered her face with
her hands. &ldquo;Oh, I can not, I can not!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>He pointed to the door. &ldquo;Go as you came; you have
no right here; I have been a fool to permit you to stay
even so long as this. Go at once, or I will have you
turned from the doors!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, stop!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;If there is no other way,
I accept your condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. But you must clearly understand that you
have absolutely no interest in the child&rsquo;s life; she goes or
comes as I bid or as I permit; you have no voice in anything
which concerns her. But you may see her, provided
always that you respect that condition, and that she does
not learn of the relationship between you. The instant
I discover that she even guesses what it is, you leave this
house, and you never return. Is that clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I accept. Indeed, if there is no other way&mdash;and
I know I deserve not even so much as this&mdash;if there
is no other way, then I am grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have need to be. For the future you take your
old name, and we will prefix something respectable to it,
for propriety&rsquo;s sake and for the child&rsquo;s. You will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
known as Mrs. Dawson, and there is no necessity for you
to tell anything concerning yourself that you do not care
to have known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand; I understand perfectly. May I&mdash;may
I see the child&mdash;now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is asleep, I suspect,&rdquo; replied the man, coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed&mdash;indeed I will not wake her,&rdquo; cried the eager
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. You will find her room at the top of the
house, the door on the left.&rdquo; Then, as she was moving
rapidly across the room, he called to her. &ldquo;You will
find a spare bed in that room; it was used by the woman
Blissett, who attends on her, when &rsquo;Linda was very ill
some time since. You may sleep there to-night; I will
have another room prepared for you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She reached the door, and then turned to look back at
him, with some words of thanks on her lips. But he
was at his desk, with his head buried among his books and
papers; and she stole quietly out and closed the door.
Then, with a light and rapid step she flew up the stairs,
calling softly as she went, in a whisper, &ldquo;&rsquo;Linda, &rsquo;Linda,
my baby!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="subheading">THE CAPTAIN IN STRANGE COMPANY.</p>


<p>For the first time in his remarkably short existence
Comethup Willis began to lead a double life. He had
already done so, to a very small extent, in regard to his
meetings with Brian and with the captain; but now he
began systematically to divide his life into two parts.
His reason for this was purely an instinctive one, and he
would have been puzzled, under any circumstances, to explain
even to himself why he saw in his childish mind that
such a course of action was necessary. But, although he
admired and almost worshipped his cousin Brian, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
being superior in every way to his very humble self and
of more brilliant parts, he yet felt that, in a delicate
matter like that on which he had embarked with the captain,
Brian must be set aside.</p>

<p>It caused him many heart-pangs to arrive at this conclusion,
but to his childish understanding it was the only
thing possible; having once made up his mind, he kept
stiffly to it. He had entered into a compact of the emotional
order with the captain, and he consoled himself for
any disloyalty to Brian with the thought that he was only
concerned with the captain in the matter, and that the
secret was not really his own.</p>

<p>This species of deception, while it added a new element
of excitement to his life, made him also frantically
desirous of falling in with every plot and plan arranged or
invented by his cousin on the few occasions on which
they met. Those occasions were few indeed, for the
captain had shown, in some curious, curt fashion, that he
did not like the boy Brian; and Brian, for his part, was
laughingly contemptuous of the captain. So that poor
Comethup, in order to keep all his friends, and in the
deep desire he had not to wound the feelings of any of
them, had a very difficult task to perform. A child of
blunter character or perception would have got through
with the matter very easily, and would not have troubled
about it at all; but Comethup took everything, even in
those days, in deadly earnest, and lay awake many nights
in the dark, sore at heart with the thought that some light
word of his to the captain, or some half-promise broken
to Brian, might have given either of them pain. Comethup
had that strange and&mdash;for the possessor&mdash;terrible quality
of being able to feel, with the utmost acuteness, any
pain borne by those with whom he came in contact; the
quality of feeling it so instantly that it was often more
real in its intensity to him than to them.</p>

<p>It is possible that the captain understood the desire
in Comethup&rsquo;s mind that Brian should not be included in
their compact to befriend &rsquo;Linda; indeed, it was a matter
so completely between Comethup and the captain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
probably neither of them would have thought of including
any one else in their confidence. Moreover, the matter,
begun in secret and at night, had, in all appropriateness,
to be carried on in the same fashion. Even the captain
was not too old, and Comethup certainly not too
young, to have a mutually romantic feeling that that was
the proper course to adopt. They talked it over together
in all seriousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Comethup,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;we were not
received with that&mdash;that cordiality which could lead us,
with any delicacy, to approach Dr. Vernier again. I&rsquo;m
not quite sure that we wish to do so; but, in any case, it
will be wiser to leave him out of the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup nodded, feeling that that argument was unanswerable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question then resolves itself into this,&rdquo; said the
captain, sitting stiffly upright, with a hand on each knee,
and looking down at Comethup, who was imitating his
attitude as far as possible, on a stool before him, &ldquo;how
are we to save fair ladies who are wandering about in
dreary woods, and getting wet, unless we do it by force
of arms, and bid defiance to the enemy?&rdquo; The captain
had, in his many conversations with the boy, got the true
poetic, romantic ring; it was a never-ceasing delight to
Comethup that his wonderful friend was able to bring
that glamour into the commonest circumstance of life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might go and walk round the house, and&mdash;and
hide among the trees until she comes out,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>The captain shook his head. &ldquo;Scarcely dignified, I&rsquo;m
afraid, Comethup,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added with
a fine air of carelessness, &ldquo;we might happen to stroll past
the place, and we might just look in at the gates, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup understood perfectly, and nodded with
much vigour. So complete indeed was the understanding
between them that, when the captain, on parting with
him, said with much ceremony, &ldquo;You might call for me
about seven o&rsquo;clock, Comethup, if you are not better employed,&rdquo;
the boy felt his heart leap, and was eager for
the expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>But the captain was a man of bluntness, and totally
unused to lurking ways. They reached the gates in the
semi-darkness, and looked in up the dreary avenue, and
then walked slowly on side by side. The captain even
waved his stick skyward, and predicted airily that it would
be a fine day on the morrow. Comethup agreed with
him, with more eagerness than befitted the occasion,
even going out of his way to recall impressions of yesterday&rsquo;s
weather as compared with the present. Then,
about a hundred yards from the gate, the captain swung
on his heel, and they strolled back again. Still no sound
about the deserted place, and no little figure in the garden.
The captain came from pretence to reality at a
bound, and faced sternly upon Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, this isn&rsquo;t right, and I&rsquo;m not right to be teaching
you to hide and skulk here. I&rsquo;m going up to the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think perhaps it would be better,&rdquo; admitted Comethup
slowly.</p>

<p>They marched with much determination through the
wind-swept garden and among the drifting leaves. Both
Comethup and the captain looked eagerly all about, but
saw nothing; they made the circuit of the house, and
then stopped at the door by which they had previously
entered.</p>

<p>The captain raised his stick and struck sharply on the
panel; waited a little, but there was no response. Then
he stepped back and glanced up at the windows; but they
were all closely shuttered, and no light appeared anywhere.
The captain stepped up to the door again and
renewed his attack on the panel. After another long
period of waiting, there was a sound of shuffling feet on
the bare boards within, and the door was opened so far
as the length of a chain that held it would allow. The
captain pressed forward to the aperture and spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Dr. Vernier within?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor say he can&rsquo;t see no one,&rdquo; came the
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m much obliged,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to know if the child&mdash;the little girl&mdash;is well? You remember
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I knows all about you,&rdquo; replied the woman
sharply. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s folks as can look after her, and
mind their business without no interferin&rsquo;.&rdquo; The door
was slammed quickly, and they heard the shuffling feet
going down the hall.</p>

<p>The captain remained very upright for a moment, recovering
himself; and then turned to Comethup. &ldquo;Let
that be a warning to you, boy,&rdquo; he said stiffly, &ldquo;never to
argue with your inferiors. The enemy is not to be surprised,
that&rsquo;s evident; we must try stratagem. As a soldier,
Comethup, I have learned that stratagem is very
useful. I despise it, but it&rsquo;s very useful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But all the stratagem the captain could employ, and
all the loyal aid given by Comethup in a cause in which
he was desperately interested, failed to bring them any
nearer the object of their search. They walked past the
garden many times after that, on many successive days,
taking it casually in their walks first, and afterward going
there of set purpose. But the garden was always empty,
and the house apparently deserted. They had almost
given up in despair, when one night, rather later than
usual, when they passed the gates, Comethup, lingering
for a moment, saw the faint flutter of something white
among the trees, and ran to it, crying softly &ldquo;&rsquo;Linda!&rdquo;
The captain went in too, but remained standing just
within the gates. With a delicacy which belonged to him,
he let the children meet in their own impulsive, breathless
fashion alone.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Linda was clinging to the boy, divided between laughter
and tears, when the captain, looking past them, observed
a figure hurrying toward them from the house&mdash;the
figure of a woman certainly not portly enough to be
Mrs. Blissett. The captain took a few strides forward,
and reached the children at the same moment that the
woman came up with them; she stood, almost in an attitude
of defiance, looking at him. He noticed that she
was tall and rather slight, and quite young. Instinctively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
his hat came off, and he bowed in his stiff fashion. For
a moment there was silence between them; each seemed to
be waiting for the other to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, sir?&rdquo; she asked at last, in a suppressed
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I merely called&mdash;came here, I should say&mdash;in the
hope of seeing the child, and knowing that she was well,&rdquo;
said the captain. &ldquo;I found her here the other night,
and, though it is no business, of course, of mine, I feared
that she was lonely, and, forgive me, perhaps neglected.
I came here a few evenings ago, but was refused admittance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a friend of&mdash;of Dr. Vernier&rsquo;s?&rdquo; she hazarded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly a friend,&rdquo; replied the captain, diplomatically.
&ldquo;We&mdash;we have met&mdash;that is all. Are you the
child&rsquo;s nurse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman bent her head and stretched an arm out,
and drew the child close against her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps you might be a&mdash;a relative,&rdquo; ventured
the captain, replacing his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, in a low voice, &ldquo;I am not a relative.
Dr. Vernier has engaged me chiefly to look after the
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said the captain, with awkward gallantry,
&ldquo;that she is in such good hands.&rdquo; The situation was becoming
embarrassing; the captain knew that he had no
earthly right there, and felt that he must withdraw his
forces without delay. He stooped, and held his hand out
to the child, who shyly took it; bade her &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo;
with much gentleness, and turned and left the garden,
followed by Comethup, who glanced back again and again
at the little white figure walking with the woman in the
direction of the house.</p>

<p>Comethup was very serious indeed as they walked toward
his father&rsquo;s house. This new figure in the story could
not be dealt with with the ease with which a mere Blissett
might be tackled. He saw a prospect of losing forever
that little figure which had so strongly interested him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
He expressed his fears tremblingly to the captain as he
trotted beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we see her again, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, Comethup,&rdquo; replied the captain, dejectedly.
&ldquo;Direct attack has failed; stratagem has failed also.
I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t do anything else to assist your little
damsel in distress, Comethup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup went to his bed, to dream that he went
again to the garden, and found the gates fastened strongly
against him; that he beat his hands against the bars of
them, crying to the child to let him in, and to the captain
to come with his sword and break the gates down. He
awoke in the dark, with the tears still wet upon his
cheeks, and cried himself to sleep again.</p>

<p>Sick with the necessity for consolation, he went on
the following morning to see the captain. The captain
had constituted himself, for some time past, a sort of
informal instructor to Comethup; had dragged from an
old box some very out-of-date lesson books, and was renewing
his own youth by plodding steadily over that first
stony ground of knowledge with the boy, taking infinite
delight in his pupil&rsquo;s progress. Comethup had learned
many things at those lessons&mdash;scraps of this and bits of
that&mdash;and had had, interwoven with the more technical
subjects, a certain thread of hard and pure and very fine
morality as to straightness of living and one&rsquo;s duty to
one&rsquo;s fellows, which had formed the captain&rsquo;s creed
throughout all his simple life.</p>

<p>On this particular morning, although neither mentioned
his distress to the other, the matter was very fully
in the minds of both, and no real attempt was made to
take lessons seriously. Indeed, the captain, with a very
fine intuition, had guessed what would be the condition
of Comethup&rsquo;s mind, and had not even got out the books.
Comethup found him standing near the window, examining,
with a somewhat troubled face, a pair of boots, passing
one finger delicately over places in the uppers which
seemed untrustworthy, and holding them from him at
arm&rsquo;s length, to get a more general effect in regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
their appearance. The soles of the boots were very thin,
and the heels rather high.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; said the captain, setting the boots down
on the window seat, and gravely returning Comethup&rsquo;s
salute, &ldquo;to pay a visit to the shoemaker&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He regarded
the boots with a thoughtful frown. &ldquo;They <i>might</i> go a
week or two longer, Comethup, but the result would
probably be disastrous. One gets used in time, when one
is not rich, to judge exactly the moment when delay, in a
matter of this kind, is no longer safe, and when the thing
must be done, if it is to be done at all. It&rsquo;s like fighting
a battle, Comethup; either you must strike at a given
moment, or you&rsquo;d better not strike at all. Will you come
with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain always addressed the boy with equal courtesy,
and Comethup had learned to reply with gravity. He
expressed his willingness now to accompany the captain,
and they set out.</p>

<p>In a quaint little street, in the very heart of the town&mdash;a
place which Comethup had not before explored, and
which was reached by diving under an archway and then
doubling sharply round a corner&mdash;they came upon the
shop which the captain sought. He had wrapped the
boots neatly in brown paper, and carried them tucked
under his arm, probably with the desire that no one should
guess his errand; he even glanced about him to right and
left for a moment before stepping into the low doorway
of the shop.</p>

<p>It was a very little shop, so low and small that it
seemed half underground; the captain, although by no
means a tall man, had to duck his head a little in entering.
Comethup noticed at once that it was not like an
ordinary shop, in that it had no counter, and that only a
heavy bench ran along one side of it, on which an old
man was seated, hammering away with much fierceness
on something fastened to his knee. But Comethup had
no time to take in more than the bare details of the
place, for his eyes were arrested by something else: a
little figure perched up on the rough bench beside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
man and looking with wide, astonished eyes at the captain
and the boy. It was &rsquo;Linda.</p>

<p>The man who worked had looked up at them for a
moment sharply out of keen black eyes, and then had bent
his head again over his leather. He worked as one in
a frantic hurry&mdash;a man who had no time for thought,
scarcely a moment even to breathe; the hammer rose and
fell sharply, rising up above the level of his head, so
closely were his eyes bent on the work. The child sat
quite near to him, smiling at the visitors.</p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s voice broke in across the hammering,
and stopped it. &ldquo;Why, little one,&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;what
are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hammer rested on the leather, the man&rsquo;s knotted
hand grasping it firmly; his black eyes looked up sideways
at the captain. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked in a quick, harsh
voice. &ldquo;What should harm her?&rdquo; He did not speak
like a countryman. Comethup was a little afraid of him,
and of his black eyes, but the child beside him only
smiled, and did not move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing,&rdquo; said the captain, hastily. &ldquo;I
was merely surprised to see the child here; she is a little
friend of mine&mdash;we <i>are</i> friends, are we not, &rsquo;Linda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child nodded, and Comethup, emboldened by her
smile, crossed to where she sat and shyly held out his
hand. She leaned forward and put her arm about his
neck and kissed him. The shoemaker glanced at them
sharply, and then, with a grunt, started hammering again
at his leather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been looking for you, &rsquo;Linda,&rdquo; said Comethup,
softly.</p>

<p>The old man caught the remark and paused in his
hammering, in the same fashion as before, and looked
quickly round at them. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what you do from
the time they lift you first into your cradle till the hour
they slip a winding sheet round you; it&rsquo;s the old story,
begun by baby lips, and whispered by the dying. Looking
for her?&rdquo; He put out a hand and touched Comethup
on the breast and pushed him almost roughly away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let be, let be; the little maid can bide here as long as
she will.&rdquo; He spoke with a certain stern sadness, and
Comethup and the captain looked at him in perplexity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re very good friends, and he&rsquo;s a good boy,&rdquo;
said the captain, laughing. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man glanced up at him sharply. &ldquo;No, but
they&rsquo;re all alike.&rdquo; He leaned forward suddenly and took
Comethup by the shoulder and drew him toward himself,
looking straight into his eyes. Comethup&rsquo;s heart beat a
little faster than usual, but he did not flinch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the captain, after the scrutiny had lasted
for some moments, &ldquo;what do you make of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shoemaker, still keeping a grip of Comethup&rsquo;s
shoulder, looked up at the captain and spoke in a low
voice. &ldquo;A good face,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the eyes of one who
will dream dreams, and carry them with him always. I&rsquo;ve
dreamed my dreams, but&rdquo;&mdash;he passed his hand over his
forehead in a lost, dazed fashion&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost them all.&rdquo;
He sighed, and took up his hammer and fell to work
again, muttering to himself. Presently, coming back to
realities with a start, he put down the hammer and asked
the captain civilly if he could do anything for him.</p>

<p>The captain produced his parcel and began, with great
care, to point out exactly what he wanted done and what
he desired left undone. The shoemaker obviously saw
here a work on which his finest arts could be exercised,
and listened with equal care to the minute directions.
The business being finished and the price arranged, the
captain lingered in the doorway of the little shop and
carelessly put a question:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she come often to see you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When she will,&rdquo; replied the old man, softly hammering.
&ldquo;Sometimes a week goes by and I see nothing of
her; and then she&rsquo;ll slip in and sit beside me for an hour,
and be gone again&mdash;so lightly that I think afterward it&rsquo;s
a dream, and that she has not been here at all. It&rsquo;s all
dreams; nothing is real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid some things are very real,&rdquo; said the
captain gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He brought the hammer down sharply to emphasize
the word. &ldquo;If they were real we could not bear
them; we should go mad. It&rsquo;s because they are dreams
that we can laugh a little sometimes and say that it
doesn&rsquo;t matter, and pray for the hour when we shall wake.
Nothing&rsquo;s real, nothing&rsquo;s real; we should be glad of that.&rdquo;
He fell to hammering again, in the same hurried fashion
as when they had first seen him. Indeed, nothing would
rouse him again; even when the captain asked that he
might take the girl with him, and she slipped down from
the bench and walked with Comethup to the door, the
shoemaker merely raised his eyes for a moment to look
at her, and went on again with his work. They heard the
noise of the hammering long after they had passed
through the doorway and through the little street; it
only seemed to die away when they came out through
the archway into the busier parts of the town.</p>

<p>The captain had a delightful new pupil that day. The
three went out to the marshes beyond the town, and
there, at Comethup&rsquo;s modest suggestion, the captain assisted
in the building of the forts and instructed &rsquo;Linda
in the first principles of military tactics. She proved an
apt and eager pupil, overleaping obstacles which appeared
to present themselves to the slower mind of the captain,
and showing a delightful sense of the fine art of strategy
and a quickness of resource in a difficult situation, which
elicited that gentleman&rsquo;s warm approval. In the most
natural and fearless fashion she walked back with them
to the captain&rsquo;s cottage and partook of the captain&rsquo;s
simple dinner, unconsciously and quickly taking a position
in the small household which no one had dared to
occupy before. She showed unbounded delight at the
salute given by Homer, the captain&rsquo;s man, and actually
called him back into the room again and insisted on his
repeating the performance in order that she might see
exactly how it was done, making the blushing man do it
very slowly indeed, that she might take in every turn and
twist of his arm.</p>

<p>Comethup trembled a little, lest the captain should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
take offence; but the captain&rsquo;s heart had been taken by
storm, and he allowed the mite to rule him as completely
as she appeared to rule others with whom she came in
contact outside her father&rsquo;s house. Finally, Comethup
received instructions to take her back home in safety; and
the two children set off hand in hand, the captain standing
at the garden gate of his cottage to watch their departure.
She had completed her conquest of that gallant
warrior by seizing him by the lapels of his coat and
drawing his head down in the most unexpected fashion
and kissing him before she dashed out of the cottage with
Comethup, whose salute to the captain was a mere undignified
flying wave of the arm, in consequence of her haste.</p>

<p>At the big iron gates which led to her father&rsquo;s house
they saw the woman standing who had been in the garden
on the previous day; she drew the child swiftly within
the gates, and went down on her knees and held her close
to her breast without a word. Comethup, embarrassed,
stood looking on, not knowing whether to go or to stay;
he felt, however, that the necessity of the situation compelled
him to explain the child&rsquo;s absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We met &rsquo;Linda quite by accident,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
captain and I, and she has had dinner with the captain.
I do assure you, ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;&mdash;he had got that phrase from
the captain&mdash;&ldquo;that she has been perfectly safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am quite sure she has,&rdquo; replied the woman,
looking round at him with a smile. &ldquo;And I am very
grateful to the captain and to you.&mdash;Say &lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo;
&rsquo;Linda,&rdquo; she added to the child.</p>

<p>Comethup was getting quite used to that rapturous
hug with which &rsquo;Linda favoured her friends&mdash;was getting
rather to like it. He lingered for a moment outside the
gate, until the two figures had disappeared, and then sped
away homeward, planning for to-morrow, and for many
other morrows, in which the captain and &rsquo;Linda explored
again with him the wonders of the old town and of the
buried ramparts, and renewed acquaintance, for &rsquo;Linda&rsquo;s
sake, with all the strange things he had learned under the
captain&rsquo;s tuition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>It happened that night that the captain was restless
and ill at ease. A man of simple tastes and simple habits,
he had lived for some years in the old town, scarcely seeing
any one but his man Homer before Comethup came
into his life. It had cost him not a little to shake himself
free from the stiff and rigid rules of life into which
he had grown; but, led by Comethup&rsquo;s persuasive hand,
he had done so, and had, in a sense, renewed his lost
youth in the child&rsquo;s company. He was frightened a little
now sometimes when he thought of what it would mean
to him if, by any chance or change of circumstance, he
lost the boy; he dared not contemplate the barren life he
had been content to live for so long, nor think how empty
it would be if he had to return to it.</p>

<p>And now, in the strangest fashion, this child had led
him to another&mdash;had brought even a softer element into
his life, and increased his responsibilities. The captain,
in a gentle, foolish fashion, was proud of those responsibilities,
and would not willingly have let them go. He
might have argued with himself that the children had
natural guardians who could look after them, and whose
rights were greater than any he possessed; but he plumed
himself with the idea that the children had turned to
him, and relied upon him more completely than on any
one else. As he paced about his little room in the dark,
he seemed to feel again that baby&rsquo;s arm round his neck
and her soft, rounded face pressed to his hollow one; he
thought of her sitting in the strange company of the old
shoemaker; remembered, with a pang, the forlorn little
figure he had first seen in the garden.</p>

<p>It all ended in a determination to see the shoemaker
and to learn something more of him. He had visited him
on one or two occasions when a specially delicate matter
of repairing had to be explained and when the man
Homer could scarcely have been intrusted with it, but
beyond that he knew nothing of the man. The captain
weighed the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of the matter carefully, and
finally put on his hat and set out for the shoemaker&rsquo;s
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a fine moonlight night, and the captain, on
turning into the little street through the archway, saw
that the door of the shoemaker&rsquo;s shop was open, and that
the man he sought was sitting on the step, with his feet
in the room and his back propped against the doorpost.
The captain walked on, carelessly swinging his cane, and
trying to hum a tune; stopped opposite the little shop, and
remarked upon the beauty of the night. The old man
grunted some inaudible reply, and looked up at him suspiciously;
he was smoking a short, black pipe, pulling and
puffing at it as furiously and rapidly as he appeared to
do everything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve come about those boots&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began
aloud, but the captain checked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; of course I did not expect them yet,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;I happened to be strolling round this way, and
thought I should like a chat with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shoemaker took his pipe from between his teeth
and stared at the captain for a moment; then replaced
the pipe and nodded. The captain was a little disconcerted,
but he had an obstinate feeling that he would
not go away with his purpose defeated, and so he leaned
against the other doorpost and smiled and nodded back
at the shoemaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said airily, &ldquo;I was interested in what you
said to-day&mdash;about&mdash;about what you call your dreams;
and about&mdash;the child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shoemaker did a surprising thing: he got up suddenly,
thrust his face toward the captain, and looked
at him in the moonlight steadily; then turned abruptly,
and stumbled down the two steps which led into his shop,
leaving the captain gasping and staring after him. In a
few moments the captain, looking in through the doorway,
saw the glimmer of a light; then saw the old man
bending to light a candle which stood on the bench while
a gigantic shadow, grotesque and hideous, danced and
sprawled all over the wall behind him and the ceiling
above. When he had got the candle alight, and had carefully
set his foot upon the match, he went to the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
again and beckoned. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he said; and the captain
went down the two steps a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>The shoemaker closed the door and dropped a wooden
bar across it. The door fitted above the two steps; the
shoemaker seated himself upon the topmost one and
waved his hand toward the bench, on one end of which
the candle stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>The captain seated himself, and glanced somewhat apprehensively
about him. The window was shuttered, and
the tools with which the man worked had been piled neatly
together on a little table with a raised edge which stood
against the wall. Boots in every stage of formation and
repair lay all bout the place&mdash;some mere gaping upper
parts, and others having but the faint suggestion of what
they might ultimately become in roughly cut leather
sheets. The captain drew his coat-tails about his knees
and rested his hands on them, and waited for the other
to speak. The shoemaker waited for some moments, and
then began in a low voice, with his eyes bent on the
ground:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t born in these parts&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter where
I came from; some might call me a rough and common
man, working at a dirty trade. Yet time was when I
read and talked and held my own with men who&rsquo;d been
to school and college. Many and many a night I&rsquo;ve laid
awake reading and thinking and working&mdash;trying, as men
say, to better myself. And what has it all brought me?&rdquo;
He threw out his arms with a passionate gesture and
without raising his head, and let them fall at his sides
again.</p>

<p>The captain was silent, wondering what was coming,
seeing in the man&rsquo;s attitude and in his voice some long,
pent-up story, and wondering, in his simple fashion, why
the man should have chosen him to hear the tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My life was not all work and book-learning. I married.
Looking at me now, any man might say I am a
hard and bitter creature; but I was the happiest in the
world then. We had a child&mdash;a baby girl&mdash;the fairest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
sweetest thing that ever came straight out of God&rsquo;s
arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sprang up with a cry and waved his arms fiercely
above his head. &ldquo;Straight out of God&rsquo;s arms!&rdquo; he cried,
in a loud voice. &ldquo;Let any man deny that she has gone
straight back into them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is dead, then?&rdquo; said the captain softly.</p>

<p>The man dropped his arms and stared about him for
a moment helplessly. &ldquo;Yes, but that happened long
after. I can remember her now, as a tiny child, coming
into the room where I worked and climbing on the bench
beside me, and prattling to me in her baby fashion&mdash;music
sweeter than any other that a man hears. I wish&rdquo;&mdash;he
had begun to roam restlessly up and down the place,
swinging his arms as he went&mdash;&ldquo;I wish it might have
been possible for her to remain like that forever. But,
of course, that wasn&rsquo;t to be. She grew up, and I was
proud of her and proud to think that she belonged to me
and held me dearer than any one else. Then into our
paradise came the man&mdash;as the man always comes. I
think he must have loved her&mdash;at first, at least; she was
so good and beautiful and pure that no man could pass
her by and look into her eyes without loving her. And
then&mdash;oh, ages ago; I&rsquo;ve forgotten when it was&mdash;she went
away, and wrote me a letter saying that she had gone
with him and that she would never forget me, and that
some day she would come back with him, and that we
were all to be happy together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s elbow was resting on his knee and his
head was propped on his hand, so that the hand shaded
his eyes. The shoemaker went on, in a dull, heavy voice.
He had clearly forgotten that he had a listener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tried to find him, tried everywhere. I watched for
her, night after night, until they said that want of sleep
and care and sorrow had driven me ill. It was then I
first began to dream; I have dreamed ever since. And
when at last I was better, and was able to get again to
my work, her mother was gone; they did not tell me where
at first, but afterward I learned that she had died, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
I was completely alone. I came here then; it was a place
where no one knew me, and none could ask questions.
And here, two years ago, a letter followed me, written by
the man, and saying that she was dead. That is the
hardest thing of all&mdash;that she died in some strange land,
far over the seas; and I can not even know where she
lies buried, or where she sleeps, or whether the sun shines
on her grave. It doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain raised his head and looked at him. &ldquo;Perhaps
she was happy in her new life; perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man broke in upon the words fiercely. &ldquo;She died
in shame and want and misery. The man had tired of
his plaything; in his cold and brutal letter he told me
that they had not agreed, and that he had deemed it
wiser to part from her. He begged of me to believe&rdquo;&mdash;the
scorn in the old man&rsquo;s voice as he flung out his arm
passionately was terrible&mdash;&ldquo;that he would have married
her had it been possible; he was sorry for her death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had drawn his arm, in an uncouth fashion, across
his eyes, and his voice shook as he finished. Presently he
let his arm fall to his side and looked about him in that
curious, helpless way, with something of a smile upon his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you see,&rdquo; he went on, in a gentler tone, &ldquo;I
live on here from day to day, and dream my dreams; and
am happy to forget sometimes which is truth and which
is dream. And then quite suddenly one day, while I sat
at my work here, I lifted up my eyes and saw&mdash;O God,
my heart leaps now when I think of it!&mdash;saw <i>her</i>, as
I thought, come back to me, a baby again, standing in
the doorway smiling. That was the best dream of all;
that is the best dream still.&rdquo; He raised his eyes, laughed
aloud, and clasped his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she come here often?&rdquo; asked the captain,
gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, often and often. We do not even speak to each
other sometimes, but I like to feel her close beside me,
just as the other one sat, ages and ages ago. Who
knows&rdquo;&mdash;he laid a hand upon the captain&rsquo;s arm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
sank his voice to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;who knows but that she is
mine, come back, like a fairy child, in purity and innocence,
to comfort me, and to tell me that all the rest has
been a dream indeed? How else should she come to me?
Yes, I like to think that&mdash;it comforts me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain would not have stripped away that dream
from the man for the world. He was so touched that he
begged quite humbly that he might be permitted to come
again to see him; and finally went out into the darkness
and took his way homeward. But the captain was
troubled in spirit, and the shining heavens above him did
not seem to have quite the clear and fine message of peace
that they had held so long for his simple soul. He took
a circuitous route, and came again to the great dreary
place where the child lived and looked in through the
dilapidated gates. He sighed a little as he turned away,
and whispered softly, &ldquo;God keep you, baby&mdash;God keep
you!&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="subheading">IN WHICH SEPARATIONS ARE SUGGESTED.</p>


<p>In quite the strangest and yet the most natural way
the old shoemaker was drawn into that little circle which
revolved round the captain. It was a curious little band
in most respects, formed of strange beings, with nothing
of the practical about them; the captain seemed sometimes
to be the youngest of them all.</p>

<p>Comethup&rsquo;s life, at that enchanting time, was very
full indeed&mdash;so full that he had sometimes to stop and
gasp with wonder at all the extraordinary things and the
extraordinary people that filled it. The captain had been
something to be grateful about, and to hug one&rsquo;s self
over; the ghost in the garden had resolved itself into a
very sweet and tender personality. And now came this
wonderful old man, who hammered away half underground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and talked sometimes like a book and sometimes
like scraps out of twenty books, all disjointed; whose hair
was wild and whose eyes shone, and who was something
to be a little afraid of at first and to love desperately
afterward, although, for that matter, there were but few
people who came into Comethup&rsquo;s life that he was not
able to give some part of his heart to. There was but
one little hunger in his heart, and that was that he could
not bring Brian into what he would have termed the
chief glory of his life, for he had that keen and unerring
instinct which told him that Brian would be impatient of
the old shoemaker, and as scornful of him as he was of
every one else who did not exactly please him.</p>

<p>Comethup got quite into the habit of paying hurried
visits to the shoemaker&rsquo;s shop, and then lingering for a
while, in the fascination of the man and of the place.
Very often he found &rsquo;Linda there, seated silently beside
the man on the bench. Very few customers ever seemed
to come there, and the few who did took no notice of the
children. The old man&rsquo;s moods varied greatly: sometimes
he was in a savage humour and worked fiercely,
hammering away at the leather as if for dear life, and
taking no notice of the children; at other times he would
sit, with his hands clasped idly on his apron, staring
dreamily out of the window, and occasionally muttering
to himself. On one such occasion he called Comethup
suddenly to him and put his arm about his shoulders and
stretched out the other hand toward the window. &ldquo;Look,
boy, look!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup gazed blankly through the window, the
panes of which were of old and common glass that distorted
everything seen through them. He shook his head,
and looked round at the old man. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;only the houses, and the church spire at the end of the
street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shoemaker shook him gently but impatiently.
&ldquo;Look again,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;move your head from side
to side, as I move it&mdash;so. See the houses leap and jump
and tremble; see the spire of the church double up like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
reed, and seem as if it would plunge down into the street.
Again&mdash;move your head again&mdash;see how they leap and
tremble and fall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup, a little frightened, moved his head, and
then laughed faintly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only the glass,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but a man may sit here&mdash;a man poor and humble
and with no power&mdash;and yet dream that he has the
power so to sweep away those who have wronged him; to
bring their fine houses tumbling about their ears, like
things built of cards. Boy, I tell you if a man can dream
that, he is stronger and greater than those who have the
power to build&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup obediently said, &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; and
the old man laughed, and took up his work and fell to
hammering. Comethup, after he reached home, tried the
plan with other windows, and trembled a little when he
remembered the fierce whisper in which the old man had
spoken; he wondered, too, why he should carry in his
breast the desire to injure any one, or to wreck what he
had built. Meanwhile, Brian had to be reckoned with;
it was impossible to ignore him completely, and the hours
which Comethup spent with him were growing fewer and
fewer. But one morning he sprang suddenly into the
very midst of it all, as it were, and quite accidentally.</p>

<p>He had been attending the grammar school on the
outskirts of the town, in a desultory fashion, staying
away when it pleased him, throwing his soul into the work
for a day or two, and thinking of nothing else, and then
disappearing for the whole day for about a week, dashing
home, tired and hungry and dusty at the end of each day,
and refusing any account of his movements. Once or
twice, when Comethup had been away with the captain,
he had heard on his return that his cousin had called;
but when he went himself to his uncle&rsquo;s house, to express
his contrition, Mr. Robert Carlaw airily informed him
that he hadn&rsquo;t the remotest notion where Brian was, or
what he was doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takes after his father, the young rip. I was just the
same when I was a boy; began to go to the devil before I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
was breeched. It&rsquo;s in the blood, and, damme, I&rsquo;m the last
man to try and stop him, the rascal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup usually came away feeling desperately sorry
for his cousin, and trembling considerably at the thought
of the path that unfortunate youngster was treading, yet
having, nevertheless, a sneaking admiration both for him
and his ways.</p>

<p>It happened, on the morning in question, that Comethup
had arranged to meet the captain; they would, in
all probability, find &rsquo;Linda at the old shoemaker&rsquo;s, and
after that there was the glorious prospect of some hours
on the marshes in the captain&rsquo;s delightful company, with
deeds of daring to be recited and romantic possibilities
to be discussed. It had been firmly agreed upon between
the captain and Comethup as to what their duties were
to be in a moment of emergency, should the old town,
for instance, be attacked by an alien foe, and &rsquo;Linda carried
off by the besiegers. Comethup almost wished, with
a beating heart, that it might happen, because, according
to the captain&rsquo;s account&mdash;and the captain was very serious
when he mentioned it&mdash;it would mean midnight rides, and
shootings, and maimings, and slaughterings to an absolutely
delightful extent.</p>

<p>But this morning disappointment was in store for
them. &rsquo;Linda was not to be discovered at the shoemaker&rsquo;s,
and the old man, being in a bad humour, growlingly stated
that he knew nothing about her, not even pausing in his
hammering to make the remark. Comethup and the captain
turned away sorrowfully. Former experience had
taught them that it would be useless to apply at her
father&rsquo;s house; but they walked past it, and Comethup
even ran a little way into the garden, and softly called
her name. But there was no response, and, after waiting
a few moments, they were compelled to set out on their
expedition without her.</p>

<p>She had taken so prominent a part in their lives of
late, and imagination so cruelly suggested her figure in
every place they visited, that the business of the day had
no zest in it. The captain presently seated himself on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
bank out on the marshes, with his cane lying across his
knees, while Comethup sprawled at his feet and watched
the distant line of the sand hills beyond which the sea
lay. Suddenly the captain sat rigidly upright and stared
away across the marshes in an opposite direction to that
in which Comethup was looking; an ejaculation escaped
his lips, and Comethup twisted round on one elbow and
followed the direction of the captain&rsquo;s gaze.</p>

<p>Two figures were running toward them, coming breathlessly
over the uneven ground, and waving to them as
they ran. Comethup sat up with a start. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s
&rsquo;Linda!&rdquo; he exclaimed; and then, in a more surprised
tone, &ldquo;and Brian!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two came up pantingly, and the girl dropped down
beside Comethup; the boy Brian tossed his hair back from
his face, and burst out with his tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been looking for you everywhere,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;You know I couldn&rsquo;t find you at your house&rdquo;&mdash;this
to Comethup&mdash;&ldquo;nor at the captain&rsquo;s; and dad was
in one of his frightful tempers, and had been raving about
the house, swearing he&rsquo;d kill me. He often does that, you
know; I&rsquo;m quite used to it. So you see I didn&rsquo;t know
what to do, until at last I thought of that house we went
to see, Comethup, you know, the one that was haunted.
It wasn&rsquo;t half bad in the daylight, and it wasn&rsquo;t haunted,
after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;And so does the
captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you find this&mdash;this child?&rdquo; asked the captain,
dropping one hand lightly on the girl&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that,&rdquo; replied Brian, briskly. &ldquo;I
went into the garden and had a good look round, and
there didn&rsquo;t seem to be anything to be afraid of. So I
walked round the house to see what there was to be seen,
and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you saw me up at the window,&rdquo; broke in &rsquo;Linda,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>The boy smiled back at her, and dropped down beside
her on the sandy ground. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
you if you were the ghost, and what you were doing up
there; and you said you were waiting for Comethup. And
I said that I was looking for him, too, and we&rsquo;d better
go and look together. Then I showed you how to get
down from the window by the ivy, and&mdash;and here we are.&rdquo;
He rolled over on his back, crossed his hands under his
head, and laughed again.</p>

<p>It was all true. He had stormed the situation in a
fashion which neither Comethup nor the captain would
have dreamed of; had flung himself joyously, as it were,
into the midst of a matter from which they had innocently
plotted to exclude him. &rsquo;Linda, too, had entertained
him with an account of all that had happened:
of her expeditions with Comethup and the captain,
down to the minutest details, proud of the fact that
she had so much to tell to this new and charming companion.</p>

<p>Comethup and the captain, with a quick mutual appreciation
of the matter born of their intimacy, glanced at
each other rapidly; the captain turned away his head, and
sighed a little. &rsquo;Linda saw that, in some strange fashion,
she had offended her former friends; the keen edge had
been taken from the adventure, and she looked at Comethup
with a little sudden quivering of the lip. Brian,
blissfully unconscious, lay on his back on the ground,
whistling softly to himself.</p>

<p>The situation was becoming embarrassing, and the
captain had just cleared his throat, with the idea of
making some commonplace remark which should set them
all at their ease, when, looking up, he descried another
figure coming swinging toward them at a rapid rate. The
swirl of the coat-tails and the poise of the hat were not
to be mistaken. He exclaimed hurriedly, &ldquo;Brian, here&rsquo;s
your father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian Carlaw turned lazily over on one side and surveyed
the approaching figure; resumed his former attitude,
and said with a laugh: &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s come to kill
me; I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d find me here.&rdquo; He appeared quite
unconcerned about the matter, and Comethup could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
help looking at him with increasing admiration as he observed
his indifference to the approaching danger.</p>

<p>But it was obvious, as Mr. Robert Carlaw drew nearer,
that he had no hostile intention. He was apparently
greatly agitated, and seemed to be shouting something to
them as he almost ran forward over the ground. He
waved in his right hand a sheet of paper. He came upon
the waiting group literally at a bound, and so out of
breath that for a few moments he could do nothing but
alternately thump his chest and tap the sheet of paper
with a trembling forefinger and stretch it out appealingly
toward his son. His dignity was too great to permit him
to sit down, even on the bank beside the captain; he remained
pacing about, and gaspingly endeavouring to
speak for some moments, before he could get a word out,
and when the words came they were, in view of what
Brian said, certainly surprising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, my beloved son!&rdquo; He stretched out his
arms toward the recumbent boy, and something seemed
to catch in his throat, as though he swallowed with difficulty.</p>

<p>Brian raised himself on one elbow and looked at his
father through half-closed eyes. &ldquo;I thought you were
going to lick me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw again agitatedly indicated the letter.
&ldquo;My boy, forgive me, I beg. This is a moment when
indiscretion, hastinesses of temper, may be forgotten.
This is a moment that comes but once in every man&rsquo;s life.
You are not&mdash;not too young to understand. My boy, I
have sought for you&rdquo;&mdash;he swept his arm vaguely toward
the horizon&mdash;&ldquo;everywhere. I have been cut&mdash;cut to the
heart at the thought that I&mdash;I had driven you from me.
My son, thank Heaven I have found you!&rdquo; He took off
his hat, breathed heavily, and mopped his face with
a delicate handkerchief. They looked at him in astonishment,
not unmixed with awe; he appeared to be so
terribly in earnest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is anything the matter?&rdquo; asked the captain, breaking
a silence which began to be oppressive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert Carlaw replaced his hat at a greater angle than
usual, struck himself on the breast, laughed, and shook
the letter at the little captain with ferocious playfulness.
&ldquo;Matter, sir? Matter enough! No longer can it be said
that Robert Carlaw and his son hide their heads under a
bushel&mdash;or under two bushels; this letter, sir, contains the
promise of fortune&mdash;fortune rightly bestowed. No longer
shall my son live obscurely, as his wretched parent has
been compelled to do; no longer shall he herd with the
sons of tradesmen and commoners; henceforth he takes
that brilliant path which Fortune has mapped out for
him.&rdquo; He laughed again, and stretched out his arms
again toward Brian, who was sitting up, staring at him
in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said the captain
mildly.</p>

<p>Robert Carlaw, feeling that he had to deal with inferior
minds, came down from the heights. &ldquo;My dear
sir, the matter, bluntly, is this. We are friends here,
and there is no reason why all the world should not know
such news as I have to tell. This, sir&rdquo;&mdash;he indicated the
paper he held&mdash;&ldquo;is a letter from an eccentric lady, of&mdash;er&mdash;excellent
birth&mdash;in point of fact, my sister; older than
myself, a spinster, and childless. She writes, in her dear
eccentric fashion&mdash;sweet woman, but, like myself, a spice
of brimstone in her&mdash;to say that her loneliness tells upon
her with advancing years; that she seeks some one to
whom she may give what tenderness is in her, some one
who shall become her heir. She suggests&mdash;nay, in her
eccentric fashion, demands&mdash;my son. He is to fill the
vacant place in her heart, and in her house; he is to
become, when it shall please the good Lord&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Carlaw
raised his eyes piously, and touched the brim of his hat
with his fingers&mdash;&ldquo;to call her from us, the possessor of
her wealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very fine for the boy,&rdquo; said the captain
slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded Mr. Carlaw, thoughtfully, &ldquo;the boy
is like his father; he was not built for toil. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
those who are made&mdash;positively made, sir&mdash;to cut a figure
in the world, that duller eyes may look on them, and
admire. I am one of those; it is in the blood; Brian is
another.&rdquo; With a great show of hurry upon him, he
thrust the precious letter in his pocket, and stooped and
caught Brian by the arm and dragged him to his feet.
The boy, with that unbelief in his father which past experience
had probably sown deep in his breast, resisted a
little, and did not enter quite so joyously into the spirit
of the matter as his parent wished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what have I got to do?&rdquo; he asked, petulantly,
rising slowly to his feet with his fathers assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; exclaimed that gentleman. &ldquo;My son, there
is not a moment to be lost. You do not know your
Aunt Charlotte; I have but stated the case mildly when
I say that she is eccentric. She may change her mind at
any moment; may have forgotten the suggestion she
makes in this letter before we have time to reach London.
Come; there is not a moment to be lost; it is the
opportunity of a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re going to London, are we?&rdquo; asked the boy,
his face brightening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my son,&rdquo; cried Mr. Carlaw, clapping him affectionately
on the shoulder, &ldquo;to London! London the
glorious, the wonderful! London, where you shall take
your place among the best of them, and be no more hidden
from sight here. Your poor father would have taken his
place among its notables years ago, but that the purse-strings
had to be kept too tightly. Come, my son, it
wrings a father&rsquo;s heart to have to part with you, but
Fate has been good to you, my son, Fate has been very
good to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had got his arm round the boy&rsquo;s shoulders, and was
actually dragging him away, without remembering the
proprieties, when Brian turned and looked back over his
shoulder, compelling his father to halt for a moment.
The smile that Comethup thought always was like light
played about his face for a moment as they sat there
watching him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go a bit,
but if dad says I must, there&rsquo;s no help for it. Good-bye;
don&rsquo;t forget me. I won&rsquo;t forget you, any of you,
and I&rsquo;ll come back soon to see you. Good-bye, Comethup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last they saw of him was his slight, boyish figure,
still encircled by his father&rsquo;s arm, going across the uneven
ground toward the town. Mr. Robert Carlaw was waving
his disengaged hand enthusiastically in that direction, as
though he pointed to fortune and all desirable things.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="subheading">COMETHUP SUFFERS A LOSS.</p>


<p>Comethup was glad to think, as he sat at the captain&rsquo;s
feet, looking after Brian and his father, that Brian had
appeared to remember him last and most of all; he was
glad to recall it afterward when Brian was gone. The
suddenness of the boy&rsquo;s departure made the whole circumstance
more surprising and dramatic than it otherwise
would have been; this sudden whipping of him off
into fortune and grandeur, at a few moments&rsquo; notice,
quite took away Comethup&rsquo;s breath. Indeed, the emotional
meeting between father and son, acted out to the
accompaniment of sounding phrases on the part of Mr.
Robert Carlaw before their very eyes, had held them all
breathless. It was only when the two figures disappeared
over a ridge that the three watching ones seemed to gasp
in concert, and to blink their eyelids, as though awaking
from a dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said the captain, pushing his hat back
from his forehead and looking down at Comethup, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
very sudden, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; In his simple heart, although he
scarcely liked to acknowledge it to himself, he felt a certain
great relief come upon him with the departure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
father and son. It can not be actually said that he disliked
Brian; but he was puzzled by him&mdash;perhaps even a
little afraid of him. With their going, the peace of the
day seemed to be restored, and the captain could find it
in his heart to hope that fortune might indeed be awaiting
Brian in London, and that the boy might remain
there to enjoy it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Comethup, smothering a
sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect you&rsquo;ll miss him?&rdquo; said the captain.
Comethup detected, with quick sympathy, young though
he was, a little note of jealousy in the captain&rsquo;s tones,
and did not reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t want to go,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Linda, slowly, with her
eyes still turned toward where the two figures had disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ll warrant he&rsquo;ll want to stay,&rdquo; said the
captain sagely, with a laugh.</p>

<p>They fell to talking of him, and of the wonder of his
sudden fortune; and from that the captain drifted into
telling them of London, and of the width and length of
its streets, and the glory of its buildings, and the wonder
and mystery that the monster held, a riddle never to be
read. He went on talking of the place, as he had known
it years before, almost forgetful of his audience, while the
children listened breathlessly. Presently, remembering
where he was, and that time was flying, he got up abruptly,
and took a hand of each and marched them off to his cottage
to dinner.</p>

<p>Comethup felt his cousin&rsquo;s absence more than might
have been supposed. Now that there was no longer any
necessity for fitting in his meetings with the boy and
with the captain so as to preserve with nicety the balance
between them, he blamed himself, in his sensitive little
soul, for possible past neglect, remembered that Brian
had called to him last of all before he disappeared, and
wished many times that he could have made some atonement.
The charm of Brian&rsquo;s light-hearted, mad way of
taking life, his resource and daring, were full upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
gentler boy; his disappearance to claim that mysterious
fortune which awaited him seemed but a fitting part of
all he had done before. Comethup thought of him at
night when he lay awake; pictured him in those wondrous
streets and palaces and buildings, the glory of which the
captain had but faintly suggested; saw him petted and
admired; looked forward to a time when he would come
back to the sleepy old town, richly dressed, perhaps even
with a carriage and prancing horses, to pay a flying visit
to his old friends.</p>

<p>Nearly a week went by, during which he paid his daily
visit to the captain, and saw &rsquo;Linda once or twice, and
went through the old quiet routine. He had almost settled
in his own mind that Brian had gone out of his life,
and was beginning, with the carelessness of childhood,
to dismiss the matter from his mind, or at all events to
cease to think strongly about it, when one evening, as he
sat at the window of his father&rsquo;s house, conning over a
lesson which the captain had set him, he heard a shout,
and, looking up, saw with astonishment the laughing
face of Brian on the other side of the glass, nodding at
him. Comethup had time to notice, even as he hurriedly
pushed open the window, that there was no new grandeur
about Brian: that he wore the clothes he had been accustomed
to wear, and looked in every respect precisely as
though he had never set out with his father to discover
his eccentric aunt and her great wealth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve come back!&rdquo; gasped Comethup.</p>

<p>Brian leaned his elbows easily on the window sill, and
nodded and laughed. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come back.
But we had a lot of fun and saw a lot of things. My
word, you should see London!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Comethup was absolutely palpitating with questions.
&ldquo;But have you come down to see us? And how
long do you stay? And when are you going back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian laughed, and shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going
back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand it; all I know
is that my aunt didn&rsquo;t like me, and she and dad almost
had a fight about it, and called each other names. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
never saw such a rumpus. And now we&rsquo;ve come back,
and it&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo; He laughed quite light-heartedly and
good-naturedly, with no appreciation of the disaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t have the fortune?&rdquo; said Comethup,
looking at him with wide, distressful eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t want it. I couldn&rsquo;t possibly have
lived with her; you never saw such a woman. Why, she&rsquo;s
quite blind, and goes feeling her way about with a stick.
And if anything upsets her she swears, just as dad does;
I really don&rsquo;t know which of them got the best of it.
But I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s all over, although dad went on like a madman
about it at first. But he&rsquo;ll get over that in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t go to London again?&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. But we had fun while it lasted. I believe dad
went back to her house every day from the hotel to try
and see her, and kept on ringing the bell until he found
it was no use, and then we came back here. Of course
I don&rsquo;t care a bit; I don&rsquo;t want her beastly money; but
I&rsquo;d liked to have stopped in London a little longer; it
was jolly&mdash;would have been jollier if dad hadn&rsquo;t been
in such a fury all the time. Good-night; we&rsquo;ve only just
got back, you know, and so I ran round to see you. Good-night!&rdquo;
He was off out of the garden and down the
street almost before Comethup could gasp out a reply.</p>

<p>The true story of that visit to London, and its failure
as a commercial speculation, only came out long afterward.
Indeed, nothing in regard to it would have been
known had not Mr. Robert Carlaw remembered that, in
the first flush of his joy, he had unconsciously taken the
captain into his confidence; to return, apparently beaten
and without his purpose accomplished, would, he felt, discredit
him in that gentleman&rsquo;s eyes; and he therefore
hastened to give him some explanation, from his own
point of view, at least. He paid a visit to the captain on
the very evening of his arrival from London.</p>

<p>The captain was, perhaps, as greatly surprised by the
visit as Comethup had been by the apparition of Brian.
Mr. Robert Carlaw had lifted the latch of the cottage
door without ceremony, and stood in the dim light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the evening, a heavy figure, gazing half defiantly at the
little captain, who had risen in haste from his chair. Mr.
Carlaw, in characteristic fashion, seized the situation at
once, and plunged into his explanation before the captain
had had time to utter a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he exclaimed, advancing into the room
and stretching out a hand with much cordiality, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
surprised to see me? Confess it; I am surprised to see
myself, as our French neighbours would say. I believe I
told you when we went to London something of the object
of our visit, but&rdquo;&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders and took
off his hat with a flourish and banged it down on the little
table&mdash;&ldquo;the situation was absolutely impossible, not to
be tolerated for an instant by a man of spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain did not commit himself to any expression
of opinion. He crossed the room, closed the door, and
came slowly back again, waiting for his visitor to continue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imagine, my dear sir, what it would mean to be at
the mere beck and call of a petticoat&mdash;and such a petticoat!
All women are unreasonable&mdash;dear creatures, I
admit, and they&rsquo;ve played the devil with Bob Carlaw&mdash;but
there is reason in all things. To be confronted with
a shrieking harridan who doesn&rsquo;t know her own mind for
five minutes together, who insults her own flesh and
blood.&rdquo; (Mr. Carlaw struck himself frantically on the
breast and wagged his head) &ldquo;and loads my cherished son
with reproaches&mdash;no, sir, it was not to be borne. Charlotte
is a dear sister and a worthy woman, and I esteem
her; but&mdash;there are limits. I trust, whatever my faults
may be, that I shall never be accused of a lack of what I
may term the gentler virtues. Vices I have, but they are,
thank God, the vices of a gentleman. In short, sir, the
situation was impossible. I am glad to think that I controlled
myself and&mdash;as a soldier might express it&mdash;retreated
with dignity. Frankly, I do not mind confessing
that the loss, from a monetary point of view, is great.
My son will not set forth upon that career for which I
had destined him with such bright prospects as he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
have done. But, sir, you will agree with me that there
are limits&mdash;limits which may not be passed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw leaned back in his chair and gazed
at the ceiling; he breathed heavily, and tapped the fingers
of one hand upon the table. The captain began to think
that he had misjudged Mr. Carlaw, and that he might be,
after all, rather a fine fellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;for the boy&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; for myself I do not care; the world has handled
me roughly, but I have contrived, thank Heaven, to turn
a smiling face to it, as a gentleman should. I have hopes
for my son; he is not&mdash;not of common clay, and I think
you will admit that his appearance is such that he should
be able to cut a figure in the world. My dear sir&rdquo;&mdash;he
leaned forward and spoke confidentially&mdash;&ldquo;I will not deceive
you. There may have been&mdash;nay, there was&mdash;a selfish
thought in my breast in the matter. I had a vision of
my son taking his place, as he should take it, with the aid
of that wealth without which we can do nothing; and I
had a vision, too, of his old father, who would do him
no discredit, mind you, leaning upon the boy, perhaps
even guiding him a little, amid the many temptations
which would beset him. I repeat, I may have had such a
thought, but it was not wholly selfish; it was for the boy&rsquo;s
sake, entirely for the boy&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain began sadly to think that he had been
a little hasty in forming that better judgment of Mr.
Carlaw; but he spoke diplomatically. &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you would have been of great assistance to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My knowledge of the world and of its pitfalls would,
of course, have enabled me to support rather than to
lean upon him,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;But, there, it&rsquo;s useless
talking of the matter; the thing is done. You may
not be aware of it, my dear sir,&rdquo; he added, moodily, &ldquo;but
disastrous luck has followed me&mdash;dogged me&mdash;all my
days. Think of this: here is my son, who, it has been
said, favours his father, and is&mdash;again I am quoting
others&mdash;decidedly a handsome boy. Yet what does it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
avail him? Nothing; for the very woman whom it is
necessary to impress is stone blind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blind?&rdquo; ejaculated the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Did you ever hear of such a piece of misfortune?
I do not refer to her, but to the boy&rsquo;s prospects.
Had she been able but to look at him&mdash;only once&mdash;the
thing would have been different. But it happens that she
was born blind; she is the sturdiest and the strongest of
the family; but her very affliction caused my father to
leave practically the whole of his fortune to her. I was
left to struggle along on a mere pittance. My younger
sister, since dead, got nothing. Yet that very circumstance,
which has given her every luxury which money can
command, is the undoing of my boy&rsquo;s fortunes. Think
of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then did she&mdash;did she object to the boy?&rdquo; asked the
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would have nothing to do with him; didn&rsquo;t like his
voice; didn&rsquo;t like his manner of speech to her; didn&rsquo;t like
anything. Then, again, she got on troublesome family
matters&mdash;matters on which we were never able to agree;
she rubbed me very much the wrong way; in short, the
whole thing was impossible. I shook the dust of her
house from my feet and came away. Mine is a nature,
sir, that will not brook interference; that bows to no
man, certainly to no woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got up, picked up his hat, and began to move
toward the door. He had something further, however, to
say; the nervousness of his manner proclaimed it. The
captain rose politely to open the door for his guest, and
Mr. Carlaw swung round in the doorway, as he put on
his hat, and spoke in a less self-confident manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I am bound to confess that&mdash;that the matter&mdash;has
troubled me. I had&mdash;well, perhaps I hoped great
things for the boy, that Fortune might smile on him more
kindly than it has done on his wretched father.&rdquo; He
laughed, and shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;However, that&rsquo;s
done with; I desire to hear no more about it. After all,
I suppose we all take our throw with the dice at Fortune&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
table some time or other; if we lose&mdash;well, we take our
bad luck like gentlemen still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly,&rdquo; murmured the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I believe that I&rsquo;ve mentioned&mdash;something about
the matter to you before our departure for London. Of
course, I regard you as&mdash;well, may I say?&mdash;a friend; and
it is hardly necessary for me to add that I have no desire
that this matter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was stumbling so awkwardly among his words that
the captain came a little stiffly to his relief. &ldquo;The matter
is not one which concerns me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and as I
have been honoured with your confidence, I shall, of
course, regard it as a confidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw&rsquo;s face cleared suddenly, and he
darted out a hand and caught that of the captain. &ldquo;My
dear sir, I knew it was unnecessary for me to make such
a request. You are very good. Good-night, good-night!&rdquo;
He went swinging away through the garden and down
the street, humming a tune as he walked. The captain
stood looking after him.</p>

<p>Within a few days matters had settled down to their
usual routine. It seemed impossible that Brian could ever
have been away, or that it could ever have been suggested
that his absence was to be permanent. Comethup was
quite glad to have his small circle of friends complete
again, and, as Brian himself did not appear to regret
the loss of that visionary fortune, Comethup began to
think that it could not matter so very greatly after all.
In those early days, on which the child looked back so
often afterward, there was nothing to mar his peace of
mind, now that Brian had been admitted, in a sense, into
complete intimacy with them all by his discovery of
&rsquo;Linda, except one circumstance&mdash;a circumstance small
enough in itself, but one which troubled him nevertheless.</p>

<p>Brian, eager at all times to be in the very thick of
everything, however slight, that was in progress around
him, had paid a visit to the shoemaker&rsquo;s shop, going there
with Comethup one morning in search of &rsquo;Linda. Before
they entered, he had glanced up at the overhanging shop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
front, and had read there the painted name of the proprietor,
&ldquo;M. Theed.&rdquo; He appeared to carry the name in
his remembrance after he entered the place, and to be
fitting it together in some way and puzzling over it.
Even as he saw &rsquo;Linda seated on the bench, and nodded
laughingly to her, he turned in his quick fashion to the
old man, who had ceased hammering and was looking
curiously at him, and asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your other name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shoemaker looked at him for a moment in silence,
and then replied slowly, &ldquo;Medmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer name,&rdquo; said the boy&mdash;&ldquo;Medmer Theed;
and what a queer place you&rsquo;ve got here!&rdquo; He glanced
round, and then appeared to dismiss the matter altogether
from his mind. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to find &rsquo;Linda,&rdquo; he
added.</p>

<p>The old man laid down his hammer and put an arm
about the child, as though to draw her to him. Comethup
was a little surprised and a little frightened, on glancing
at him, to see the expression of his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the little maid stay here,&rdquo; he said, almost in a
growl; &ldquo;she has naught to do with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian stared at him and laughed, and looked with
raised eyebrows toward Comethup. Comethup came
quickly to the rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Brian is our great friend&mdash;my cousin, you
know. He&rsquo;s known &rsquo;Linda a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shoemaker did not reply for some minutes; he
sat, with his arm drawn round the child and his head
bent, muttering to himself. Then presently, with a sigh,
he withdrew his arm and took up his work, and began
hammering again steadily, as though no one were near
him. After waiting for a few moments, Comethup drew
nearer to the bench; and &rsquo;Linda scrambled down and
put her hand in his, and prepared to go with them.
Comethup politely wished the shoemaker &ldquo;Good-day&rdquo;;
but he kept on steadily at his work, and did not appear
to hear. The three children went out together, and down
the little narrow street. Comethup, glancing back over
his shoulder for a moment, saw that the shoemaker had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
come to the door of his shop, and was standing there,
with one hand shading his eyes, looking after them.</p>

<p>Nor did his distrust of Brian appear to leave him. Absurd
as it may seem, when the object of that dislike was
so young a boy, the old man&rsquo;s feelings were not to be mistaken.
He maintained a rigid silence whenever Brian
came near him, even watched him suspiciously; and although
the boy, conscious of it, tried every art and charm
he possessed to ingratiate himself with the shoemaker,
he signally failed. His boisterousness and high spirits
were useless here. Medmer Theed, like most distorted
characters, was evidently as strong in his dislikes as in
his likes, however unreasonable the former might be.</p>

<p>Nearly a year had slipped by since the sudden journey
of Brian and his father to London&mdash;a year of uneventful
things, during which Comethup plodded steadily on with
his elementary studies with the captain, and made, according
to that gentleman&rsquo;s glowing accounts to David
Willis, considerable progress. David Willis, in his talks
with the captain, was full of vague schemes for the boy&rsquo;s
future&mdash;schools he should attend, and the prizes he should
gain, and the brilliant things he should do generally. The
two men nodded heads over him on winter evenings long
after he was asleep, the captain taking as much as, if not
more, personal pride in his achievements than the father.
David Willis had, of course, made up his mind that the
boy must be a musician; it was the one profession in the
world, and there were great prizes in it&mdash;prizes which
David himself had never been able to clutch, but which
would lie easily within the reach of his son. The captain
said nothing on that point, but shook his head in secret
as he walked home through the frosty streets; there was
but one profession in his mind for Comethup, and he&mdash;the
captain&mdash;had already sown the seeds which should
make for an abundant harvest in it. Comethup Willis
should yet shine in the annals of his country as a greater
soldier than the captain had ever been, and should be
able to point with pride to the man who had first given
him a lesson in military tactics. The captain did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
see quite clearly how it was all to be managed; but Fate
is good in the case of such a wonderful boy as Comethup,
and things could be done somehow. At all events, there
was plenty of time yet.</p>

<p>So another summer came round again, with its promise
of a renewal of all the old delights, and Comethup
was eight years old. Not a great age, certainly, save to
the mind of a little child; but Comethup was older than
his years, and looked on life, perhaps, with graver eyes
than most. Nothing seemed to have changed in his small
world; the captain looked exactly the same as of old, and
carried himself as stiffly erect as ever. &rsquo;Linda had grown,
but not to an extent to be marked by one who saw her
almost daily. Then suddenly into Comethup&rsquo;s quiet life
came a great and terrible change.</p>

<p>One summer Sunday morning he was waiting as usual
for the captain at the door of his father&rsquo;s cottage. The
bells above him were ringing for church, and he was expecting
every moment that his father would pass him,
as usual, with his books under his arm, and a kindly
word for the child on his lips, on his way into the church.
But this morning, although he could see at the far end of
the sunlit street the figure of the captain marching toward
him, he had seen nothing of his father; and the
bell above him had started that slow, dull tolling which
gave warning that it would stop in a few moments. Fearing
that something might have delayed his father, or
that he might&mdash;although that seemed impossible&mdash;have
forgotten the time, he turned, and ran up the stairs to his
father&rsquo;s room. It was a small room near his own; the
big best bedroom in which he had been born and in which
his mother had died, was never used, and was always kept
scrupulously clean and neat behind its closed door.</p>

<p>But David Willis was not in his room, and Comethup,
a little vaguely frightened, was coming down again, when
he saw that the door of the unused room stood slightly
open. He paused, and then drew near and peeped in.
In the semi-darkness&mdash;for the blinds were always drawn
there&mdash;he saw his father kneeling beside the great bed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
with his arms stretched out upon it, and his head buried
between them; he seemed to be praying. Ashamed even
at the thought of prying at such a moment, Comethup
stole gently down the stairs, turned at the foot of them,
and called loudly to his father, for the bell had stopped
ringing now, and the captain was standing, watch in hand,
in the cottage doorway.</p>

<p>He heard a movement above him, and his father came
hurriedly down the stairs. He looked dazed, and something
glistened about his eyes like tears; but Comethup
had never seen a man cry, and did not believe that they
could, and therefore dismissed that suggestion as impossible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I had quite forgotten,&rdquo; said David Willis, glancing
with a smile at the captain. &ldquo;And the bell has
stopped. I must hurry.&rdquo; He went past them at a run,
and Comethup and the captain quickly followed.</p>

<p>Late though he was, he paused for a moment at the
church door and looked away across the little graveyard
to the mound which Comethup had seen him decorate so
often with flowers from his dead wife&rsquo;s garden; then,
remembering himself, he hurried into the church. The
captain and Comethup crept in noiselessly by their own
door and got into their places. They heard the first
wheezy sounds of the organ above them, and then the
first notes of the voluntary; then, even while the congregation
were rising to their feet, the organ stopped abruptly,
dying away on a long, thin note like a wail.</p>

<p>In the silence which followed&mdash;a silence in which he did
not even seem to hear the sharp whispers of those about
him, and in which the beating of his own heart was painfully
loud and stifled&mdash;Comethup had time to feel with
unerring instinct that something dreadful had happened.
Moreover, the captain, who was looking up toward the
organ-loft, had closed his hands on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder with
a grip which hurt him. A moment later, while the people
were still standing looking up in the same direction, the
captain had pushed past Comethup, bidding him, in a
stern whisper, to stay where he was, and was making his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
way toward the organ-loft. Some one near at hand&mdash;a
woman&mdash;cried out suddenly, and there was a movement
about her, and, before Comethup had quite realized all
that had happened, another woman, young and pretty and
with eyes that smiled at him through tears, had glided
into the pew where the boy stood and had drawn him
down on the seat, with his head against her breast. Then,
dimly understanding that something was very wrong indeed,
he clung to her, and let his tears have vent.</p>

<p>The next thing that he remembered was that the captain
was in the pew behind, bending over and touching
his head softly with one lean old hand; the woman was
rocking him to and fro and murmuring to him, as though
he had been in pain. And the people were all rustling out
of church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said the captain, in a low voice, &ldquo;you did not&mdash;did
not know your mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy turned his head and looked up at the captain
without answering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was very beautiful and very good, Comethup.
She&mdash;she went away when you came into the world. Your
father was very fond of her&mdash;loved her dearly.&rdquo; The captain
bent his head, turned away his face, and lowered
his voice. &ldquo;And he is gone to meet her. Come home
with me, Comethup.&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="subheading">THE COMING OF AUNT CHARLOTTE.</p>


<p>Comethup slept that night on a hastily made-up bed
in an empty room of the captain&rsquo;s cottage. He remembered,
long afterward, standing in the room, holding a
candle, and shaking every now and then from head to foot
with the last of his sobs, while the captain and the man
Homer shook out the sheets and punched the pillows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and made the bed as comfortable as they could under the
circumstances. It was made up on some old boxes and a
chair or two, and the captain was touchingly apologetic
about it and its meagreness. Comethup assured him,
however, that it would be quite comfortable, and undressed
and got into it gratefully; for the excitement
of the day had worn him out, and he was very soon asleep.
Before consciousness completely left him, however, he
had a dim idea that the captain stole softly into the room
more than once and bent over him to listen to his breathing,
and then crept away again. But so dim was the recollection
that he thought afterward it might only have
been a fancy.</p>

<p>Breakfasting with the captain was a new experience.
The meal passed almost in silence, for Comethup was
still weighed down by the strangeness of his situation,
and the captain, for his part, felt that gravity was necessary
to the occasion. Even in that house, so far away
from the actual house of death, everything appeared subdued.
The captain gave his orders to Homer in a lower
tone than usual, and addressed his few remarks to Comethup
in a voice that was scarcely more than a whisper.
Moreover, the boy found that a new and sad importance
had been thrust upon him by the event of the previous
day; the captain was kinder even than usual, had pressed
simple dishes upon his notice, and was particular about
the sweetening of his very coffee. Comethup found, too,
that this importance clung to him after he had passed
into the streets. People turned and looked after him
as he walked beside the captain, and whispered; more
than one seemed to possess an inclination to stop and
speak, but the captain held steadily on, and stopped for
nothing.</p>

<p>Comethup had expressed a wish to go back to his
father&rsquo;s house; had put the matter delicately and with
tears, in his desire not to wound his friend&rsquo;s feelings, and
in fear lest the captain should think him ungrateful. But
he could not bear the thought that his father was lying
alone there in a house which he seemed to know by instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
would be more hushed and melancholy than the
captain&rsquo;s. So they went together.</p>

<p>Halfway to the house they saw, swinging toward them
down the street, Mr. Robert Carlaw. He carried a beaming
face, and took up even more of the pavement than
usual as he walked. At the sight of Comethup he seemed
to recollect himself; the expression of his face changed,
and he sighed. The captain would have passed on, after a
word or two, but Mr. Carlaw stood full in the way on the
narrow pavement, and there was nothing for it but to
stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my poor little friend! I have been thinking of
you all night; have passed a sleepless night. These things
touch me more acutely than you might imagine; my
nature is highly strung and these things wound me&mdash;cut
me to the heart. But&rdquo;&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders and
shook his head&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;in the midst of life we are in death,&rsquo;
you know, and I suppose we must all be prepared for these
things.&mdash;It was very sudden, eh?&rdquo; he added, turning to
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Terribly sudden,&rdquo; replied the captain, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! these things are not in our hands. I am sorry,
very sorry; the shock of it has even tempered the joy I
have in some unexpected news this morning.&rdquo; His face
began to beam again, try as he would to control it, and
the captain looked at him with rising anger, but had no
time to utter a protest; the other swept on with what he
had to say, scarcely taking breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A letter&mdash;yes, my dear sir, another letter has arrived
from that dear eccentric soul, my sister. She appears to
have repented of her conduct to me and suggests&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear sir,&rdquo; began the captain, &ldquo;this does not
concern&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait!&rdquo; cried the other impulsively. &ldquo;She suggests
that she will come here&mdash;here, to this very town,
at once&mdash;to-day. With some compunction, I suppose, for
her behaviour to me&mdash;although, Heaven knows, I have
forgotten and forgiven it long ago, poor soul&mdash;she suggests
that she will not stay with me, but will put up at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
inn. Oh, I know her; I know the dear creature. Protests
are useless. I must go to the best inn this wretched
town can boast and secure rooms for her. Think of it,
she may arrive at any moment. And Brian, the blessed
rascal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain pushed hurriedly past him and went on
his way. But Mr. Carlaw in a moment came running
after them again, and strode along beside them with a
forlorn expression of countenance and with a hurried
appeal to Comethup to bear his trouble manfully, and
to look to something higher for consolation. Then he
turned, and was off again, his step growing jauntier as
the distance increased between them.</p>

<p>The captain strode along fiercely, muttering to himself;
only at the garden gate did his features relax, and
he passed into the house with a gentler face.</p>

<p>The dead man had been carried in there and laid in
that big best room upstairs. Comethup had a wish to
see him, and expressed it to the captain. But the captain
shook his head. He sat down and drew the boy, in
the old fashion, against his knee, and put his arm about
him. &ldquo;There are foolish, morbid people, boy, who&rsquo;d be
only too glad to let a little child look on death; but if
you&rsquo;ll take your old friend&rsquo;s advice, don&rsquo;t do it. I told
you that he had gone to meet your mother; all the best of
him has gone, and what is left scarcely concerns us any
more. If you saw him now you would carry the remembrance
with you to your grave. He died quite suddenly,
and very peacefully; think of him as you saw him last,
when he stood at the church door in the sunshine, with
a smile upon his face. The rest is nothing, boy; the best
of him is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup urged no more. The very tones of the captain&rsquo;s
voice seemed to bring peace and consolation to him,
and he went about the house&mdash;into every room except
that which was closed against him&mdash;and wandered in the
garden of the roses, almost believing that the roses
drooped their heads a little, in pity for his sorrow.</p>

<p>While he was wandering aimlessly there he heard a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
noise in the street beyond, and saw that a fly had driven
up and stopped. The driver descended from his box and
opened the door, and out of the vehicle got, with considerable
difficulty, a strange figure. It was the figure of
an elderly lady, very richly dressed and enormously stout&mdash;so
stout that Comethup saw she had a difficulty in getting
through the narrow doorway of the fly. Her difficulty in
alighting appeared, too, to be increased by the fact that
she groped for the step with one foot, even though her
arm was resting on the arm of the driver. She had a
heavy black polished stick in her hand, and when she
reached the pavement, still leaning on the man&rsquo;s arm,
she moved the stick gently in front of her, as though to
feel her way. As the man pushed open the garden gate,
and allowed her to walk inside, Comethup saw that her
eyes were closed, and that she still moved the stick in
front of her, feeling her way delicately with its point
along the edge where the gravel joined the grass. Comethup
knew then that she was blind.</p>

<p>The man walked behind her, as though to render assistance
if necessary, but she came on fearlessly, stopping
when within about a foot of where Comethup stood,
drawn up close at the side of the path. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;
she asked sharply.</p>

<p>Comethup was about to reply, but she felt her way
to him, dropped her hand on his shoulder, and shook
him a little. &ldquo;I want a man called Willis&mdash;David Willis.
Is this his house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup, at a loss what to say, was in danger of being
shaken again, when the captain appeared at the door.
He came forward courteously, with a hand extended to
guide her. &ldquo;This is David Willis&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Are you seeking him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am. What the devil should I be here for if I
weren&rsquo;t? Gracious&mdash;what ridiculous questions people can
ask on a hot day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I assist you, madam?&rdquo; asked the captain, making
a step forward.</p>

<p>But she waved him back fiercely. &ldquo;Keep off, keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
off!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a baby, and I can find my way
alone, even in such a pokey place as this.&rdquo; Still pushing
Comethup before her, she got into the house and, in some
fashion or other, into the little parlour. The captain had
backed nervously away from her, as though he were backing
from royalty, and now stood at a few paces distant,
indefinitely waving his hands toward a chair which he
had placed for her. But she stood, and waved her stick
round the room, like some strange enchantress, still
keeping her hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder. There was an
awkward pause for a moment or two, and then she
spoke again, with growing impatience and in a higher
key.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, where is the man? Everybody seems to have
lost their wits to-day. That infernal driver at the station
sighed, as though his breakfast hadn&rsquo;t agreed with
him, when I mentioned where I wanted to go; and now
here&rsquo;s a man and a boy who&rsquo;ve lost their tongues, and are
staring at me as though I&rsquo;d just come from paradise.
Will no one speak? Where&rsquo;s David Willis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;David Willis is&mdash;is upstairs, madam,&rdquo; said the captain,
with the idea of breaking the matter gently to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, fetch him down. Gracious, what fools men
are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regret that it is impossible,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s the matter with the man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;David Willis is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead! What on earth are you talking about?&rdquo; she
asked, sharply. She sat down then, still keeping her grip
of Comethup&rsquo;s shoulder and leaning heavily on her stick
with the other hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you the simple truth,&rdquo; replied the captain.
&ldquo;David Willis died quite suddenly yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, and appeared to be ruminating,
although there was no expression save that of
baffled anger on her great face. Comethup, glancing
timidly up at her, saw that above the face, and under her
bonnet of many colours, was a great mass of very beautiful
snow-white hair. After a moment she spoke again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
although her voice was scarcely any more gentle than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is the last time I&rsquo;ll come on such a fool&rsquo;s
errand as this,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ve been wandering
about since early morning, swearing at porters and wondering
all the time why I ever started, and the very man
I came to see has died before I could get to him. Why
the devil couldn&rsquo;t he die next week, or a month ago, or
any other time? Who are you, sir?&rdquo; she asked, quite
suddenly and fiercely, addressing the captain.</p>

<p>The captain presented himself with some formality,
and she nodded at him in acknowledgment. The captain
went on to state briefly that he was a friend of the
dead man, and had come there that day chiefly on account
of the child. She became alert and eager in an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;d almost forgotten it. I heard there was a
child. Where is he?&mdash;what is he?&mdash;how is he?&mdash;can&rsquo;t you
speak, man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is beside you now, madam,&rdquo; said the captain,
quietly.</p>

<p>She twisted Comethup round, and dropped her stick
with a clatter, and took him by both shoulders. Comethup
almost felt that the closed eyes could see him, so
closely did she hold him for a moment and so still did
she sit. Then, in the same abrupt fashion as before, she
cried: &ldquo;Well, can&rsquo;t you speak? What&rsquo;s your name, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comethup Willis,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>

<p>She dropped her hands with startling suddenness from
his shoulders and got up, and spread the hands out before
her. She was shaking and trembling violently, and the
corners of her mouth were twitching. &ldquo;Who spoke?&rdquo;
she asked, and her voice had fallen almost to a whisper.
&ldquo;Whose voice was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain wonderingly replied that it was the boy
who had spoken. She passed her hand across her forehead
once or twice, still trembling a little; it seemed as
though she were trying to recall some old remembrance,
to bring back something which had long since slipped
away from her. Presently she sighed, then laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
nervously, and then frowned. &ldquo;Give me my stick there,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>Comethup picked up the stick and put it into her
hand. She closed her own hand over his and detained
him, felt for her chair with her foot, and sat down again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, ma&rsquo;am, if I frightened you,&rdquo; said Comethup
politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t frighten me; it wasn&rsquo;t that. I&mdash;I
like to hear you speak. You never saw your mother, did
you?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Comethup. &ldquo;She died when I was
born.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, you&rsquo;ve got her voice, boy, just as she used
to talk to me. That&rsquo;s what startled me, coming from the
grave like that.&rdquo; Still holding his hand, she sat for a
long time with her chin resting on the top of her stick
and without taking the slightest notice of anybody.</p>

<p>The captain broke the silence at last. &ldquo;May I suggest,
madam, that we have not the pleasure of knowing&mdash;of
knowing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat up with a start. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d forgotten all about
it. My name&rsquo;s Carlaw&mdash;Charlotte Carlaw. I&rsquo;m this boy&rsquo;s
aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I met your brother this morning in some excitement,&rdquo;
said the captain. &ldquo;He informed me that he had
had a letter from you, and that he expected you to arrive.
He was on his way to engage rooms for you at an inn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup, watching her face, saw that it began to
work convulsively in a most appalling manner; then she
bent over her stick and began to shake; and finally her
great face broke up altogether and she burst into hearty
laughter, swaying and rocking herself in her chair and
seeming as though she would never stop. When, presently,
she recovered somewhat, she ejaculated breathlessly:
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s good; Brother Bob flaring about the
town, looking for me, and seeing that my bed is properly
aired, and that fires are lighted, and warming pans got
ready, and that people understand my due importance.
Oh, it&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s very good!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He seemed very anxious, certainly,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anxious? I should think so. I knew what a tremor
he&rsquo;d be in when I sent that letter. Well, I only hope
he&rsquo;ll engage rooms at every blessed inn in the place&mdash;and
pay for &rsquo;em. I won&rsquo;t stop anywhere now, especially a
place of his choosing. No inn shall hold me; I&rsquo;ll stop
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear madam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the captain.</p>

<p>She turned on him fiercely. &ldquo;Silence, sir! How dare
you? This is my brother-in-law&rsquo;s house, and I have a
right to stop here if I will. What&rsquo;s it to do with you? I
never heard of such a thing. Do you think I&rsquo;m afraid of
a dead man, or forty dead men? I&rsquo;ll stop just where I
please, I&rsquo;ll have you know.&rdquo; She turned away from him
angrily, and drew Comethup toward her. Bidding him
stand quite still, she began to pass her hands over his face,
touching every feature so lightly that he scarcely felt
the touch at all; she dropped her hands finally with a sigh
of satisfaction, bade him speak again, and, on being
obeyed, sighed with still deeper satisfaction, and sat for a
long time deep in thought. The captain was beginning to
wonder what he should do, and was doubtful whether to
stay or to go, although he scarcely cared to leave the boy
in that house of death, when Miss Charlotte Carlaw
seemed to plunge at once into his thoughts and to know
them unerringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid to leave the boy here,&rdquo; she
said, sharply. &ldquo;I can look after myself and him better
than any two of you if I am blind. I suppose there&rsquo;s a
servant in the house, so that I can send for anything if
it&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain reassured her upon that point, and she
jerked her head at him in dismissal. The captain courteously
bade her &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; patted Comethup on the
shoulder as he passed, and went out. After a few moments
of silence she asked the boy abruptly: &ldquo;Your voice
startled me so that I forget what you said your name
was. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Comethup told her, slurring the word as much as he
could to get over the cumbrousness of it; but she made
him repeat it again and again, and each time more slowly,
until she had got it completely; then she turned it over
and over angrily, pronouncing it quickly and slowly, and
with the accent here and the accent there; finally shook
her head over it and exclaimed: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what they
gave you that ridiculous name for; I don&rsquo;t like it. We&rsquo;ll
change it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup thought of &rsquo;Linda, and of how she had expressed
her appreciation of it, and said courageously, &ldquo;I
like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then we won&rsquo;t change it,&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw, and
began to talk of other things.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the captain, on his way to his
house, ran full tilt against Mr. Robert Carlaw, who was
coming round a corner looking very dejected. He informed
the captain that he had been to the station five
times and had met every possible train, that he had engaged
rooms, that he had done everything, and still there
was no sign of that dear eccentric creature, his sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you see, the difficulty is, one never knows
when she may swoop down, so to speak, upon one, and a
man does not like to be taken at a disadvantage; naturally
he does not. This sort of thing is worrying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can relieve your mind,&rdquo; said the captain,
with a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just seen your sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw seized him excitedly by the arm.
&ldquo;Where? When? Take me to her, I beg!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain shortly related the circumstance of Miss
Carlaw&rsquo;s visit to David Willis&rsquo;s house, and, almost before
the words were out of his mouth, his hearer had turned
sharply and set off at a run, with a beaming face; his
dejection was gone, and it was only when he neared the
house that he recollected the necessity for a dignified
bearing, and moderated his pace. As he turned into the
garden, he strolled quite easily and casually up the garden
path and tapped at the door.</p>

<p>His sister heard him, and asked Comethup who it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
The boy, who had glanced out of the window, told her.
She began to laugh again, but straightened her face as
her brother entered the room.</p>

<p>That brother, who had been admitted by the little
servant, advanced toward Comethup as though to speak
to him; saw the great figure in the chair, rocking itself
over the head of its stick, and started back in astonishment.
&ldquo;My dear sister,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I never expected
to find you here. I do assure you I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell lies,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Charlotte, I have been hunting everywhere
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know that,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve just
met Captain What&rsquo;s-his-name, and he told you where I
was. Why the devil can&rsquo;t you tell the truth for once,
Bob?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sister, I do assure you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began; but
she fiercely interrupted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, save your breath. What do you want with
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like a fool; I&rsquo;m not a girl, nor a child&mdash;as
you&rsquo;ve found before to-day. When the Lord sent me
into the world without eyes, the devil gave me some of
his wits, to redress his Master&rsquo;s unfairness; you&rsquo;ve found
that out before to-day, Bob. Let us understand each
other. I simply wrote and told you I was coming down
here, because if you&rsquo;d met me unexpectedly in the street
it might have been too much for your nerves. But I
don&rsquo;t think we have anything to say to each other; I don&rsquo;t
like you, and you don&rsquo;t like me; we fought like Kilkenny
cats when we were youngsters, and you generally got the
worst of it, although I couldn&rsquo;t see where I was hitting.
Now we have to behave like decent members of society,
and we can&rsquo;t pummel each other, but I generally manage
to get the best of it still. What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw cleared his throat and settled his
neckcloth, and hesitated for a moment before speaking.
At last he began: &ldquo;My dear sister, I had hoped that some&mdash;some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of the unpleasantness which embittered&mdash;yes, I
repeat, embittered&mdash;my visit to London might have been
swept away at this later interview. Of course, I admit
that the fault was mine&mdash;it must have been&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry yourself; it <i>was</i> your fault. But we
don&rsquo;t come any nearer to what you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Carlaw sighed, and stretched out his hand toward
his sister; showed his teeth in a fierce grin, and shook a
fist at her. &ldquo;I have endeavoured to explain. My object
in desiring to meet you is a pure and a simple one&mdash;I may
say a brotherly one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She began to rock herself over the head of her stick
again in that dreadful fashion which had alarmed Comethup
before. The boy would have been glad to escape
from an interview in which he appeared to have no part,
but that Miss Carlaw had laid her hand again on his
shoulder, and was detaining him beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Bob, Bob, what a humbug you are! You&rsquo;re one
of those fellows who can&rsquo;t take a straight line. If fifty
different roads branched out before you, and you were
blindfolded, and forty-nine of those roads made for good
and the other didn&rsquo;t, by the Lord, you&rsquo;d choose the other!
I believe you&rsquo;ve always been rather popular with women&mdash;I
can see you twirling your mustache; I&rsquo;m sure you are,
you dog&mdash;but you haven&rsquo;t been popular with me. The
others had ordinary eyes to see your perfections; I had
other eyes which served me better.&rdquo; She sat up fiercely,
and brought her stick down sharply on the floor. &ldquo;Why
the devil can&rsquo;t you be honest? Why can&rsquo;t you say that
you want my money? There, don&rsquo;t protest; I swear I&rsquo;d
like you the better if you&rsquo;d only say straight out what you
want. You&rsquo;ve got all our late respected father&rsquo;s cant and
none of his firmness. Now, listen to me. Are you listening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am all attention, my dear Charlotte,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Robert Carlaw, humbly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then; let me tell you at once that I&rsquo;m sick
of all this hunting and bowing and scraping after a poor
old blind woman&rsquo;s money. Hear me, you rascal! I&rsquo;ve had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
not an ounce of real love or real pity on this benighted
earth since my mother died, years and years ago. People
have professed to pity me for what they deemed an affliction,
and have whispered in the next breath that my
money was surely a compensation. There have been men
low enough and mean enough to be ready to marry me&mdash;professing
all sorts of things&mdash;for my money; my own
flesh and blood, in the shape of my dear brother Bob, is
prepared to grovel and bend humbly before me, in the
hope that I may remember him, and that he may fatten
on what I leave when he has ceased to remember me.
Listen to me again. There is no more accursed being on
God&rsquo;s grossly mismanaged earth than the forlorn creature
with money, and without that which money can not buy.
Now, brother Bob, I&rsquo;m getting old, and there&rsquo;ll be a
chance for some of you before long to fly at each other&rsquo;s
throats on my account. But I&rsquo;m going to try an experiment;
do you understand me&mdash;an experiment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw at once expressed the keenest interest.
&ldquo;Delightful! What vigour you still possess, my
dear Charlotte! What is the experiment to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. I&rsquo;m going to make myself useful for
once, in a way, if I can. I haven&rsquo;t quite lost sight of the
hope that there&rsquo;s some good, some sweetness, in the world.
You don&rsquo;t possess any, but that probably isn&rsquo;t your fault.
I don&rsquo;t possess much, although I&rsquo;m a devilish sight better
than you are; but I may be able to find some. I&rsquo;ve been
haunted a little lately by the memory of that girl&mdash;our
sister&mdash;who didn&rsquo;t care, or seem to care, a bit for any of
the things I clutch so strongly, and you would clutch if
you could. She was fool enough, in the world&rsquo;s eyes, to
wait twenty years for a man who wasn&rsquo;t fit to touch her
hand&mdash;at least that&rsquo;s my view&mdash;and then to die before
she quite knew what the experiment was worth. God forgive
me!&mdash;I might have eased the way for both of them;
but I chose to laugh, as others did, and then was too
ashamed afterward to do anything. Look here&rdquo;&mdash;she
pushed Comethup forward a little&mdash;&ldquo;this is her boy; and
I&rsquo;ve learned, in a pretty long experience, to judge people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
by their voices and by their faces, for I can know a face
better than you could if you had a dozen eyes. Bob,
my dear, I&rsquo;m going to make up for past neglect. This child
is left alone in the world; I&rsquo;m going to look after it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw&rsquo;s jaw dropped; he hesitated a moment,
and then came forward protestingly. &ldquo;But, my
dear Charlotte, may I remind you that you have already
held out hopes to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;I gave <i>your</i>
boy the chance I might have given to any one else; I can&rsquo;t
say I liked him, any more than I like his father; but he&rsquo;s
got a father to look after him, and this lad hasn&rsquo;t. Besides&rdquo;&mdash;she
laughed a little&mdash;&ldquo;your boy will make his
way in the world; he&rsquo;s got the voice and the manner for
it; he&rsquo;ll sail smoothly through things that would upset
any one else. Therein he favours his father. No, this is
my experiment, and if I can squeeze a little love and
tenderness out of this baby for my own sake, and not
for the sake of my bank account&mdash;well, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t quite
have failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She got up, still with her hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder,
and began to pace up and down that side of the room,
firing a shot or two at Mr. Robert Carlaw as she moved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been monstrous kind, Bob, and you&rsquo;ve pretty
well run yourself off those fine legs of yours on my account
this morning. I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, and,
just to show you that I&rsquo;m in a good humour, I&rsquo;ll pay
whatever bills you&rsquo;ve been incurring on my account. And
that reminds me: I suppose, with funeral about to take
place, and other matters of that sort, I should be rather
in the way here; besides, I want to go to an inn, where
I can swear at the waiters if necessary; it relieves the
mind wonderfully. So I won&rsquo;t stop here, after all; I&rsquo;ll
go to the inn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Charlotte, my house, poor though it is, is
quite at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I think not. No, my mind is made up, and
I shall go to the inn. This boy, with the name I haven&rsquo;t
digested yet, can show me the way. What is the place?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I ventured to take rooms for you at The Bell, in the
High Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good; we shall find it. Good-day to you, brother
Bob. Don&rsquo;t carry any bitter thoughts in your mind about
me, because it might destroy your sleep, and I wouldn&rsquo;t
have that happen for the world. Good-day to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was such a finality about those last words, and
she began to pace so resolutely up and down the room,
pushing Comethup before her, that Mr. Carlaw, after
opening his mouth once or twice, as if to speak, apparently
gave up the matter as hopeless, and shrugged his
shoulders and went out without a word. After he had
passed through the garden and into the street Miss Carlaw,
who had stopped in her walk, gave a short laugh
and addressed the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice man, that! Ran through one big fortune&mdash;married
money&mdash;ran through pretty well all that, with
the exception of a fixed sum which the wife was cute
enough to secure for the boy and which is tied up, so that
the father can only use so much a quarter. Oh, a nice
man! And he hadn&rsquo;t even the <i>nous</i> to go to the devil
decently, whimpered over it, and did it by halves, till the
devil must have been pretty well ashamed of his follower.
There, we&rsquo;ll forget all about it. Take me to this inn he
mentioned. Is it far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very little way, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll walk; I don&rsquo;t want to squeeze into that
wretched fly again if I can help it. And I suppose it&rsquo;s
been waiting there all this time.&rdquo; She got out her purse
and deftly opened it, seeming to know every coin it held
by the mere touch of her quick fingers, selected two coins,
and handed them to Comethup. &ldquo;There, run out and
give him these and come back to me. And, boy,&rdquo; she
recalled him as he was hastening to the door, &ldquo;just remember
that I&rsquo;m your aunt, and call me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, aunt,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup ran out and paid the driver, and ran back
again. When his cap was in his hand and she had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
him again by the shoulder she stopped, as they were nearing
the door, hesitated a moment, and then spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup laughed, and assured her that he was not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well; you&rsquo;ve no reason to be, as you shall find.
Now go on, and be careful how you go; remember you are
my eyes for the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the strange pair set out together.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="subheading">COMETHUP LEAVES THE OLD LIFE.</p>


<p>Comethup carefully conducted his aunt to the inn and
saw her comfortably established there. She appeared to
have the whole establishment, from the landlord to the
boots, at her beck and call within two minutes after passing
the portals; was ordering dishes to her liking and
sharply questioning those in attendance upon her, and
flinging out an occasional biting word of sarcasm, that
held them breathless and awed. At first she insisted that
Comethup should stay and lunch with her; but he was
equally firm in refusing. He remembered that the captain
had enlarged his own simple meal for that day on
Comethup&rsquo;s account. He was divided, as usual, between
the picture of this new friend, blind and helpless in a
strange place, and the other picture of the captain, who
had been so curtly dismissed but a few hours since, awaiting
dinner for him.</p>

<p>To his relief, Miss Carlaw appeared to understand the
situation at once. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; say what you mean,
and stick to it. I suppose you&rsquo;ve got another appointment&mdash;some
one else has asked you to dinner, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, aunt, the captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember. You needn&rsquo;t mind me; I&rsquo;m
perfectly capable of taking care of myself, and if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t do what I want here, I&rsquo;ll know the reason why, by
the Lord I will! Come back here when you leave the
captain. Off with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup was late, and, although he ran as hard as
he could, the captain had already sat down to his meal
when he arrived. His face lit up when he saw the boy,
although, quite mechanically, and for the due preservation
of discipline, he glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, sir,&rdquo; said Comethup, breathlessly, as
he saluted just within the doorway; &ldquo;but my aunt wished
me to show her to the inn, and I&rsquo;ve been detained. I&rsquo;m
very sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Come in and have
some dinner.&mdash;Homer, another plate, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very little was said during the progress of the meal.
The captain had a vague load on his mind, Comethup a
very real one. The captain had been pacing about his
room for an hour past, putting the case as clearly before
himself as he could; telling himself, in so many frank and
brutal words, that this child was an orphan and penniless;
that this strange old woman had enormous wealth, and
seemed to have taken a great fancy to the boy. Well, that
was as it should be. The boy had his way to make in the
world, and a poor old half-pay captain, going slowly but
surely toward the end of his earthly journey, was not the
man to be able to do much to help any one. The captain&rsquo;s
heart ached a little, it is true, and he looked back on
the years that had stretched before the coming of this
child, and the years that would stretch on after he had
gone.</p>

<p>Comethup, for his part, tried once or twice to break
the matter; he was not very definite in his ideas about it
at all yet; he only knew that his aunt practically claimed
him, and that she was not likely to remain in the old town
with him. He watched the captain nervously, and was
quite glad at last when that gentleman opened the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather strange lady, your aunt, eh?&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Comethup. &ldquo;But very kind, sir, I
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt of it,&rdquo; said the captain, heartily. &ldquo;She
certainly appears to be very good-hearted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was another long pause, and then Comethup
said, &ldquo;She means&mdash;means to be very kind to me, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The captain nodded, and then added, with
what cheerfulness he might: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good; that&rsquo;s very
good, Comethup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup swallowed the lump in his throat and
looked at the captain wistfully. &ldquo;She says&mdash;says she&rsquo;s
going to look after me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain nodded again, but did not speak; he
turned his head and looked out of the window at the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;afraid she may mean me to go
away with her.&rdquo; It was out at last, and Comethup waited
breathlessly for the captain to speak. But the captain
merely stood up and murmured the words of the simple
grace which closed each meal, and then walked across to
the window. He stood there looking out for a long time,
and finally twisted round and spoke a little more sharply
than usual, perhaps to hide that which he did not care
to show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, life&rsquo;s a big campaigning ground, where every
man is under orders from a general he doesn&rsquo;t even see.
Sometimes it&rsquo;s his good luck to march shoulder to shoulder
with a friend for a bit, even to fight shoulder to
shoulder with him. But an order may come suddenly,
and the one marches off to some other place where he is
wanted, or where promotion is quicker. Old and young,
rich and poor, gentle and simple, we&rsquo;re all under orders,
boy, and if at the last, when the fight is done, there&rsquo;s a
comrade beside us to close our eyes and hold our hand
for the last time&mdash;well, the great general has been merciful,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, then sat down on the window
seat and shaded his eyes with his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it should happen that you have to go out into the
great world now, as you surely must go some day&mdash;well,
I&rsquo;d be a poor fellow, and a bad friend, and no true soldier,
if I held you back. It may not happen now, but&mdash;if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
it does&rdquo;&mdash;he looked up quickly and smiled at the
boy&mdash;&ldquo;we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be the worse friends, Comethup, and we
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forget each other&mdash;shall we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup&rsquo;s heart was almost too full to reply, but he
gasped out, &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; and the captain got up with a
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well, boy. Now, I suppose your aunt will be
expecting you, and you&rsquo;d better go back to her. Please
let me know what she proposes you should do, and when
you are to leave us, if you go at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup saluted gravely and went out of the house
with a heavy heart. At the inn he found his aunt impatiently
walking up and down her sitting room; she
stopped as he entered and addressed him by name, although
he had not spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Comethup, settled it with the captain, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had dinner with him,&rdquo; replied Comethup evasively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;and talked about me the whole time, I&rsquo;ll warrant!
Well, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t mind, and you don&rsquo;t either
of you know enough of me to say any harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do assure you, aunt,&rdquo; said Comethup, &ldquo;that the
captain spoke most highly of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very nice of him, I&rsquo;m sure. Quite pleasant to know
that you impress people like that. However, we won&rsquo;t
talk about the captain now, or anybody else. Come over
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seated herself near a window and put her hand
on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder in the same fashion as before.
Comethup felt that his fate was about to be decided, and
trembled a little, a fact which she instantly detected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; she asked, although
not unkindly. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m going to eat
you, or do something else dreadful to you? Have you
ever read any fairy tales? Have you ever heard about a
fairy godmother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;m going to be your fairy godmother.
I&rsquo;m going to show you what the world is like, boy; I&rsquo;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
going to look after you, and&mdash;if you&rsquo;ve got the stuff in
you, as I think you have&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to make a man of you.
Understand this: I want to make a bargain with you&mdash;a
bargain I think you&rsquo;re sensible enough to understand.
Treat me fairly, and be straight and clear with me, and
tell me the truth in everything you do, and, by the Lord!
I&rsquo;ll never desert you; play me false, or prove anything
but what I believe you to be, and I&rsquo;ll turn you out of
doors at a moment&rsquo;s notice to starve. I don&rsquo;t want to make
a prig of you. I don&rsquo;t mind if you get into trouble, or
what you do, so that you&rsquo;re a <i>man</i>; anything short of
that I won&rsquo;t stand. Now, will you take the risk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a strange proposition to make to a child, but,
in her deep earnestness, she did not seem to understand
the strangeness of it. Comethup hesitated for a moment,
and then began politely, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you,
aunt, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but she instantly checked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that. What do you say? You must remember
that I&rsquo;m a lonely old woman, and a bit short in
my temper on occasion; but I&rsquo;ll be a good friend to you
if you&rsquo;ll be a good friend to me. That&rsquo;s fair and square,
isn&rsquo;t it? I only want you to love me a little, Comethup,
and you may be sure I shall know the difference between
the false and the real. If you try to humbug me, I&rsquo;ve
done with you. Now, what&rsquo;s it to be? Yes or No?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Not another word. If you don&rsquo;t mind kissing
a blind old fright you can kiss me, and we&rsquo;ll call it sealed.
Now, when will you be ready to start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To London?&rdquo; asked Comethup, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to London. You can&rsquo;t start being a man in this
one-eyed old town; you&rsquo;d simply vegetate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, aunt,&rdquo; he began, timidly, &ldquo;there are people&mdash;people
I should like to say good-bye to. They&rsquo;ve all
been very kind to me, and I shouldn&rsquo;t like them to
think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you were turning your back on them in a
hurry, eh? You&rsquo;re quite right, boy; only I don&rsquo;t want
to stop here forever, and you must get your farewells done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
with. How many of these people are there? Half the
town full, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Comethup, laughing; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s only
the captain and&mdash;and &rsquo;Linda&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She caught him up swiftly on that name. &ldquo;Halloo!
who&rsquo;s &rsquo;Linda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a little girl,&rdquo; said Comethup faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you dog! you&rsquo;ve begun precious early. Why,
you oughtn&rsquo;t to know what a petticoat means at your age.
Is she pretty, child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very pretty,&rdquo; said Comethup, with an air of deep
conviction.</p>

<p>She rocked herself over her stick and laughed delightedly,
and shook him by the shoulders. &ldquo;I like you
the better for it; we&rsquo;ll make a man of you all the more
easily. I suppose you&rsquo;ll break your heart, or hers, when
you leave her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be very sorry,&rdquo; replied the boy, &ldquo;and I think
she&rsquo;ll be sorry too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, you shall come back and see her; I don&rsquo;t
want you to lose any of your friends. Only, mind, I
must be first; I&rsquo;m beginning to have a devil of a jealousy
in me, child, of all these friends of yours who seem so
fond of you. Is there any one else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; there&rsquo;s Brian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady stiffened a little. &ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t break
his heart, at all events. Any one else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, one more; Mr. Theed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who the devil&rsquo;s Mr. Theed?&rdquo; she asked, wrinkling
her brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s a shoemaker&mdash;quite a nice shoemaker, I do
assure you; he has dreams, and visions, and things. The
captain likes him immensely, and &rsquo;Linda worships him.
I think that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And enough, too,&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;Lord, what a
family! The strangest collection I should think anybody
could have got together! Comethup, I&rsquo;m beginning to
think you&rsquo;re a very remarkable child. Well, how long
do you want to say &lsquo;Good-bye&rsquo; to these people? Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
course we must stay here for a day or two&mdash;until after
the funeral. Suppose we say a week; will that be long
enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup caught gladly at the suggestion, and so the
matter was settled. His aunt informed him that she had
taken a room for him at the inn, and that he was to sleep
there during the remainder of his stay in the old town.
She gave him perfect freedom during the day, making
the sole stipulation that he must dine with her at seven
o&rsquo;clock every evening; he could leave her immediately
after breakfast, but he must never fail to put in an appearance
at dinner. Having said this, she quite abruptly
dismissed him, and he left her pacing up and down the
room, with her stick lightly tapping the floor before her
as she walked.</p>

<p>That strange week passed all too swiftly. There was
so much to be crowded into it; so many delightful places&mdash;never
so delightful as now&mdash;crowded with childish
memories which had to be visited, and to which silent
farewells had to be given. Not all the importance which
his new dignity gave to him could quite swallow up the
sorrow he felt in tearing himself away from the only
place he had ever known. He wished, ungratefully
enough sometimes, that he might wake suddenly and
find that it had all been a dream, and that his aunt had
never really come into his life, save in a dream; wished
passionately that he might keep the people and the things
about him just as they had ever been. Knowing nothing
of that inevitable and seemingly cruel shifting
about of the pawn in the great game of life, he resented
it miserably and wondered why it should be necessary.</p>

<p>He saw the captain every day. Like an older child than
himself, the captain planned to make the week seem
longer than it really was; spun out the hours, arranged
excursions to their old haunts, and tried valiantly to set
aside the thought that their parting was near at hand.
Once, indeed, when they were together on the old sandy
waste outside the town he started a lesson, new and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
subtle, in military operations, but broke down in the
middle and sat brooding, with his chin resting on his
hands. They walked home silently, hand in hand, afterward,
and the captain&rsquo;s voice was husky when Comethup
left him at the gate of his cottage garden.</p>

<p>With &rsquo;Linda it was a different matter. Comethup
sought her one afternoon in the desolate garden of her
father&rsquo;s house, and, by good chance, found her wandering
alone there. She ran to him with a cry of delight and
hugged him in the usual tumultuous fashion; then, seeing
his grave face, became grave in an instant for sympathy,
and asked him what was the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m going away,&rdquo; said Comethup, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to
say good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She held him from her at arm&rsquo;s length for a moment,
and then threw her arms about him and clung to him,
and shook him despairingly. &ldquo;Oh, but you mustn&rsquo;t, you
mustn&rsquo;t! Who&rsquo;s going to take you away? What shall I
do when you&rsquo;re gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreadfully sorry,&rdquo; said Comethup, miserably.
&ldquo;But you see I can&rsquo;t help it. My father&rsquo;s dead, and my
aunt has come down to take me to London. You know,
&rsquo;Linda, there&rsquo;s the captain, and Brian, and Mr. Theed;
you won&rsquo;t be <i>quite</i> alone, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s bad of you, it&rsquo;s cruel of you!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
crying, and shaking him, and clinging to him by turns.
&ldquo;None of them are like you; I don&rsquo;t love any of them as
I love you, you know I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was very gratifying to Comethup; he felt his
heart swell within him, even in the midst of his misery.
&ldquo;Yes, I know, I know,&rdquo; he said, striving to soothe her.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m coming down to see you, you know; I&rsquo;m not
going away altogether. In fact, I&rsquo;m not going away at
all for a day or two. It hurts me very much, indeed it
does, to have to say good-bye at all; but I can&rsquo;t help
it, and I don&rsquo;t really want to go at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she was not to be soothed or convinced. He left
her in the desolate garden, with her arms laid against the
trunk of a tree and her head resting upon them. He could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
scarcely find his way between the big iron gates for the
tears in his own eyes.</p>

<p>He saw her again, a couple of days later, in the old
shoemaker&rsquo;s shop; and then, with the quick forgetfulness
of childhood, her sorrow seemed to have gone in great
measure, and she asked him eagerly about what he was
going to do, and spoke with sparkling eyes of the glories
of that London to which he was going&mdash;glories which the
captain had painted for them. The shoemaker hammered
away at his work, apparently without listening; but he
must have heard the conversation, for, when Comethup
was leaving with the girl, he ceased hammering, looked
up, and spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better have stayed here, boy,&rdquo; he said sharply.
&ldquo;Folks that go to great cities lose their dreams, lose
everything that&rsquo;s worth the keeping. You&rsquo;ll be rich;
you&rsquo;ll wear fine clothes and see fine people; it&rsquo;ll spoil ye.
That life spoils &rsquo;em all. <i>He</i> came from a great city,&rdquo; he
added, in a lower voice.</p>

<p>Comethup gently replied that he hoped it would not
spoil him; and presently, after gravely shaking hands with
Medmer Theed, went away with the girl. But, after they
had stepped into the street, the old man came hurriedly to
the door and called him back. Waving the girl aside, he
bent down and whispered in the boy&rsquo;s ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve been harsh to ye, don&rsquo;t take heed of it. And
look to yourself, boy. I had a dream of ye last night, when
the moon was high, and it troubles me. I can&rsquo;t quite
make it out, but there was blood upon you, boy, and it
frightens me. Look to yourself in that great city. Yes,
I remember there was blood upon ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup, a little frightened, stared at the old man
for a moment, and then hurriedly joined &rsquo;Linda and
drew her away. He turned the matter over in his mind
once or twice, but, remembering the wild dreams the old
man had had before, and being but a child, with many
more important things to think of, it slipped from his
memory, happily enough, and did not trouble him.</p>

<p>He took &rsquo;Linda back to her father&rsquo;s house in the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
afternoon, after roaming about with her during the day,
and set off for the captain&rsquo;s cottage. For the captain had
been invited by Miss Charlotte Carlaw to dine with her
that evening, and he was to accompany Comethup back
to the inn. Miss Carlaw had asked the boy, kindly
enough, if he would care to invite his old friend, and
Comethup had gladly seized the opportunity. He found
the captain a gorgeous figure&mdash;in his eyes at least.</p>

<p>That gallant gentleman had raked out of his wardrobe
his dress suit; it had lain there unworn for years, since
his seclusion in the country, and was very old-fashioned
and somewhat threadbare. But Comethup felt more
proud than ever of his friend, and only wished that his
aunt had eyes to see him. Comethup, for his part, cut a
somewhat better figure in the matter of dress than he
had hitherto done, for his aunt had had him measured
for a new suit of mourning, and had gone down to the
little shop at which it was being made, every hour or
two during the day, and had so frightened the unfortunate
tailor that the clothes had been completed in an incredibly
short space of time.</p>

<p>The captain put on his old military cloak, in order
to hide something of his glory from the mere ordinary
people in the streets, and the two set out for the inn together.
Comethup, remembering his aunt&rsquo;s attitude toward
the captain on the occasion of their first meeting,
trembled a little as to the reception he would meet with;
but was delighted to find that the old lady was graciousness
itself. She welcomed the captain to her quarters
with profuse apologies for the poorness of the fare and
the meagreness of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not my fault, you know, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but that infernal
brother of mine. Of course, I&rsquo;ve not been able to
discover whether there is a better inn than this in the
town, but I&rsquo;m convinced there must be, and that it&rsquo;s just
a trick on the part of Bob Carlaw to cause me annoyance.
Oh, I know him, and I&rsquo;ll be even with him some
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear, madam,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;that our little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
town is somewhat deficient in accommodation for travellers.
You see, we never have anybody here, or very
rarely. This is a very good inn in its way, and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, captain,&rdquo; she interrupted, sharply,
&ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t lived in it. I say that it&rsquo;s a devilish
bad inn. There, there, forgive my short temper. I shall
be very glad to get back to London again, where I know
every turn and corner of the house I live in, and can&rsquo;t
run against things unexpectedly. Will you oblige me,
captain, by informing me if it&rsquo;s after seven o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain consulted his old-fashioned watch. &ldquo;By
the clock of the parish church, madam, it is some three
minutes past the hour,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She rapped impatiently on the floor with her stick.
&ldquo;Comethup, ring the bell; ring it hard. I&rsquo;ll let these
people know that when I say seven I mean seven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The entrance of dinner as Comethup&rsquo;s hand was on
the bell saved a further explosion, and they sat down.
The captain could not but admire, as Comethup had done
before, the ease and dexterity with which Miss Carlaw
found everything she wanted, seeming to know by the
slightest movement of her quick hands exactly where
everything about her was. She kept up a running fire
of comment on herself and her mode of life, and on all
she had already planned to do for her nephew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose, like the rest of them, captain, you think
I&rsquo;m a helpless old woman, and bemoan my fate to be shut
up in darkness, eh?&rdquo; She went on rapidly, without giving
him time for a reply: &ldquo;Indeed, you&rsquo;re quite mistaken.
I&rsquo;ve got such a blessed lot to be thankful for that
I haven&rsquo;t time to think about any little trifle that might
otherwise worry me. Look at me, sound and strong and
hearty, with everything I want in this world, and the
other one too far off to be thought of yet a bit. Oh, and
I can assure you I&rsquo;m not a lonely old woman by any
means. I love company; I love to hear voices and laughter
and music all about me; there&rsquo;s nothing like it to
keep the heart young. I can tell you there&rsquo;s generally a
house full where Charlotte Carlaw is&mdash;and merry times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the rogues have, men and women alike.&rdquo; She paused, and
her face grew grave and thoughtful for a moment. &ldquo;Only
sometimes, when they&rsquo;re all gone, and the music has
ceased and the house is quiet, I&rsquo;ve felt&mdash;I&rsquo;m an old fool,
I know&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve felt it would be good to have some one,
pure and sweet of heart&mdash;some one who didn&rsquo;t love me for
my money, or because I said smart things, or sharp things,
or because I was eccentric; some one who&rsquo;d gone deeper
into the heart of the old woman than that, and understood
her a little. D&rsquo;you know what I mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>Comethup, at that change in the old woman&rsquo;s voice,
had unconsciously moved his hand along the table nearer
toward her; she must have been aware of the movement,
for she dropped her own unerringly upon it. &ldquo;And even
here, you see,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;the Lord was good to me;
I found this baby. I tried to find one before, but, oh!
that boy! I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forget it in a hurry. He&rsquo;ll do big
things, I don&rsquo;t doubt; there&rsquo;s no knowing what he will
do; but he was too much for me. It&rsquo;s all surface&mdash;surface
there; I suppose he can&rsquo;t help it, but it&rsquo;s all sparkle and
dash and nothing else. This chap&rsquo;s different, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather fond of the boy, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very good friends,&rdquo; said the captain, with a
smile at Comethup. &ldquo;I was a lonely old man before he
came; I suppose I shall be a lonely old man again. But
I&rsquo;m not&mdash;not such a curmudgeon that I can&rsquo;t be glad at
his good fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well spoken, well spoken,&rdquo; cried Miss Carlaw, rapping
her knuckles on the table. &ldquo;And you mustn&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;re losing the boy; I&rsquo;ll trot him down here to see you
as often as I can spare him. And you must come up and
pay me a visit in London; we&rsquo;ll always be glad to see
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup&rsquo;s face brightened, and the captain thanked
Miss Carlaw cordially. She gave the old soldier permission
to smoke, and signed to Comethup to produce a box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of cigars, the best the inn could afford, from the side-board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must forget my sex, you know, captain,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and look upon me as a host rather than a hostess.
I should probably smoke myself if it weren&rsquo;t that I&rsquo;m
afraid that I might startle this baby. Oh, I&rsquo;m going to
make a man of him, captain; I&rsquo;m going to make a devilish
fine man of him. And, by the Lord! I think he shall
be a soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain beamed upon her; saw in this the opportunity
for the gratification of those desires he had had,
but which he had seen so little prospect of carrying into
effect. With the delighted boy sitting between them,
they began eagerly to build plans for his future, until, before
the captain took his leave, Comethup had grown, in
their loving imagination, into a giant of six feet five at
least, and was a guardsman in a shining helmet and with
a long, drooping mustache. Finally, when the moment
for parting came, this extraordinary old woman started
up and insisted on the three of them joining hands and
singing &ldquo;For Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; until the tears stood in
Comethup&rsquo;s eyes and he wanted to embrace both his
friends from sheer emotion.</p>

<p>But there was a sadder day to come&mdash;a day when the
parting was to be in earnest. Comethup had already said
his farewells to Brian, who, indeed, took the matter light-heartedly
enough, and waved aside Comethup&rsquo;s carefully
prepared apology to him for having apparently stepped
into his shoes. Comethup was glad indeed to think that
his cousin bore no resentment toward him.</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Carlaw, delicately enough, had prevented
the boy&rsquo;s presence at his father&rsquo;s funeral; only on
the day following it the captain had gone with him to
the churchyard, and had shown him a new mound, on
which fresh wreaths of flowers were lying&mdash;a mound close
beside the one he already knew so well. It had been a
conspiracy between his aunt and the captain to keep his
thoughts away from that sad subject, and the boy was a
little remorseful at the thought of how well they had succeeded;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
but his father&rsquo;s life had been in a sense a thing
apart from his&mdash;a thing so peaceful and full of quiet
dreams that it seemed but a natural and fitting ending,
even to the mind of the child, that he should sleep here
calmly, in this beautiful place, beside the woman he had
loved.</p>

<p>The captain had arranged to collect such personal
effects of the late David Willis as might be of interest to
his son&mdash;personal papers, and some portraits of his dead
mother, and a few trinkets; the rest were to be sold.
Comethup&rsquo;s life in that quiet old place seemed to have
closed strangely enough; he seemed, in a sense, to have
left those who belonged to him sleeping quietly near their
home, and to be going out of the life he had known quite
naturally, now that the life itself existed no more.</p>

<p>The day fixed for the departure came at last, dawning
just as placidly as a hundred other days had dawned.
Comethup even thought it strange that people whose
faces he knew passed along in the street below the window
of the inn where he sat and went about their business
quite heedless of the small boy who seemed to be
leaving everything behind. He reflected miserably that
everything would go on just the same when he had gone&mdash;that
the snow would come, and the leaves fall, and the
roses bloom again, for some one else; that the captain
would take his walks abroad, and sit in church on sunny
Sunday mornings; that &rsquo;Linda would wander forlorn
among the trees in that dreary garden. He fell upon his
knees before he left his room and prayed desperately and
with tears that God would teach them not to forget him.</p>

<p>He was very silent over breakfast, and his aunt was
quick to understand the cause. &ldquo;What, not all the farewells
made yet, boy? How many more people have you got
to weep over before you&rsquo;re carried away captive? There,
there, I&rsquo;m not laughing at you; the Lord forbid! I dare
say you want an hour or two to yourself, just to rush
round and embrace folks. I&rsquo;ve ordered a carriage, and
I&rsquo;m going to drive to Deal. I can get a train direct there
to London; if I went to the wretched little station here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
I should have to change once at least, and that&rsquo;s a nuisance.
It&rsquo;s not a long drive, and I shall leave here directly
after lunch. Lunch at two, sharp; we&rsquo;ll leave at a quarter
to three. So I&rsquo;ll give you until two o&rsquo;clock. Off with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup made the most of those few hours. In
quite a systematic fashion he went from place to place
that he had known, going first to his father&rsquo;s house, and
looking up at the shuttered windows, for the place had
been closed, and the captain had the key until after the
sale. The boy wandered through the garden of the roses,
and into every nook and corner wherein he had played so
often in those earlier years; thence into the churchyard,
with no feeling of fear, and scarcely one of any very deep
sorrow. The place was so quiet and lay so calmly in the
sunshine, and the birds fluttered and chirped so gayly
about it, that it seemed a good thing that the two gentle
creatures, who had loved each other and him so well,
should be sleeping quietly there. He stole into the
church, sat down in the captain&rsquo;s pew, and thought of
all that had happened since last he sat there. But he
was young, and there were living things to be seen, and
he did not remain there long.</p>

<p>He ran hard to the captain, only to discover that that
gentleman was out. The man Homer informed him that
the captain had gone out immediately after breakfast,
and had not said when he would return. Comethup, after
waiting impatiently a little while, saluted Homer, and
then shook hands with him and went away.</p>

<p>The day seemed marked out for disappointment.
&rsquo;Linda was not in the garden, and when, taking his courage
in both hands, he knocked boldly at the door of Dr.
Vernier&rsquo;s house, there was no response. Nor was she to
be discovered in the shop of Medmer Theed; and that
strange old man himself appeared to be so frantically
busy that he hammered away as if for dear life, and
scarcely returned Comethup&rsquo;s greeting.</p>

<p>The boy wandered disconsolately out on to the sandy
wastes beyond the town, looking keenly in all directions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
in the hope of seeing a familiar figure. But no one was
in sight, and when presently he heard the clock of the
old church chime the three quarters he hurried back to
the inn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried Miss Carlaw as he entered, &ldquo;have you
got it all over, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen any one,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s unfortunate. But I can&rsquo;t give you any
more hours, you know. Too much emotion isn&rsquo;t good for
the young, and you&rsquo;ve had a week of it. Come, eat your
lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The carriage was at the inn door exactly to the minute,
and the small luggage put upon it. Comethup, before
he followed his aunt into the vehicle, looked wistfully
up and down the street, but no one he knew was in sight.
Their way, however, lay past the captain&rsquo;s cottage, and
there, to his infinite delight, was the captain at his garden
gate, shading his eyes with his hand and looking up and
down the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please,&rdquo; cried Comethup, frantically, &ldquo;please
may we stop?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the devil for?&rdquo; asked Miss Carlaw, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s the captain, standing at his gate, looking
for me. I really can&rsquo;t go without saying good-bye to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; I suppose you must. Call to the man to
stop. A minute, mind, no longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup tumbled out of the carriage, almost before
it had stopped, and ran back to the captain. The captain
saw the boy flying down the road toward him; tried to
salute in the old stiff fashion, but changed in a moment,
and caught the little figure in his arms and held him
tightly. For a moment neither could speak; and then the
captain, as if ashamed of showing any emotion, thrust
the boy gently away, cleared his throat, and spoke quickly.
&ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d missed you, Comethup. Make a man
of yourself, so that I&rsquo;ll be proud of you. And&mdash;and
write to me; tell me all you do. There&rsquo;s your aunt
waving from the carriage. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Comethup hurried back to the carriage, turning his
head once, as he ran, to see the captain standing stiffly at
the garden gate shading his eyes and looking after him.
The boy got into the carriage, and the horses started
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now I hope you&rsquo;re satisfied,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Carlaw. &ldquo;Just understand I don&rsquo;t stop for anything else&mdash;not
a minute. We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get to Deal this time next week
if I have to keep dropping you on the road to embrace
all the inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the carriage turned out of the town Comethup,
looking out of the window, saw two figures moving slowly
along a road across the end of which they drove. Their
faces were toward him, although they were not looking at
him; he saw that it was his cousin Brian and &rsquo;Linda.
The boy&rsquo;s arm was thrown round the girl&rsquo;s shoulders, and
he seemed to be explaining something to her about some
flowers or grasses he held as they strolled along. Comethup
gazed wistfully at them, but, remembering his
aunt&rsquo;s words, he was silent, and the carriage soon left
them out of sight. The last spire of the old town, the last
red roof, had disappeared, and only the flat country lay
on either side of the broad road. And so Comethup Willis
left the things he knew behind him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="subheading">AND BECOMES A PERSONAGE.</p>


<p>The strange pair travelled in state. Comethup had
been given such a sum of money by his aunt that the
mere handling of the yellow and white coins in his pocket
almost sufficed to take his breath away. The old lady was
so jealous that the boy&rsquo;s sovereignty should begin at once
that she left the paying of porters and the purchase of
first-class railway tickets entirely to him, merely telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
him the amounts he was to pay, and being careful, in
every instance, that the necessary homage in return for
the coin was exacted from the man to whom it was given.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he touch his cap to you? Was the rascal respectful?&rdquo;
These were her constant inquiries; and, to
do her justice, it may be said that she held her head
higher, as she walked with her hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder,
than she had been in the habit of doing. Indeed, her
blindness seemed to affect her more than it had ever done
before; she seemed anxious to know what was going on
about her, and what notice they attracted. &ldquo;Do people
stare at us? Do they whisper? Why don&rsquo;t you tell me
everything, just as you would tell it to yourself? You
must remember I&rsquo;m walking in the dark; you are my eyes
for the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, when London was reached and he had helped
her out of the railway carriage, she chuckled softly to
herself as she leaned upon him, and nodded her head
approvingly. &ldquo;You walk well, boy; you carry yourself
like a gentleman. A man always can, or a boy either,
when he has money jingling in his pockets. And I swear
that yours shall never be empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A servant in livery approached them and touched his
hat. He glanced with some surprise at the boy, and spoke
to his mistress and offered his arm to her. But Miss
Carlaw waved him scornfully aside. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t
trouble, William; I can dispense with your help in the
future. Where&rsquo;s the carriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant led the way across the station to where a
fine carriage with two horses was drawn up; he opened the
door, and Miss Carlaw got in, followed by Comethup, who
began to realize that he had indeed entered upon a life
of luxury. The noise and roar of the streets through
which they drove surprised and startled him, after the
sleepy quiet of the old town he had left. His aunt was
eager with anticipations of all they were to do, and of
all the changes she contemplated making in her own
mode of life, for the boy&rsquo;s comfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll do big things with you, Comethup; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
shall be the best-known boy in London. By the Lord!
I&rsquo;ve never had a chance like this before. I&rsquo;ll dress you like
a prince, and let them see that I&rsquo;ve got some one young
and handsome&mdash;for you <i>are</i> handsome, you dog, there&rsquo;s
not a doubt of that&mdash;some one young and handsome about
me, who loves me. Oh, I&rsquo;ll be good to you, Comethup,
if you keep to your part of the bargain, for I&rsquo;m precious
hungry for somebody&rsquo;s love, I can assure you. I&rsquo;ve waited
a devilish long time for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The carriage drew up at the door of a large house in a
square, with a huge garden, protected by an iron railing,
in the center of the square. As they alighted, Comethup
felt that it must be a very grand neighbourhood indeed,
for other carriages were stopping at other doors, and
elegant ladies were getting in and out of them. Almost
before his aunt had alighted from her carriage the wide
door at the top of the steps was opened, and Comethup
had a glimpse of a hall beautifully furnished and hung
with old-fashioned armour, such as he had heard the
captain describe in giving accounts of historic battles&mdash;a
hall large enough, the boy thought, to be a room itself,
and not a mere passageway to other rooms, as it proved
to be when they had passed through it. There seemed to
be servants everywhere, both male and female, opening
doors, and coming in noiselessly with tea, and bringing
letters and other things which had arrived for Miss Carlaw
during her absence.</p>

<p>It appeared to have been the work of a confidential
servant&mdash;an elderly, staid woman, who was apparently the
housekeeper&mdash;to open and read these letters aloud to her
mistress; but when she was about to do this now, Miss
Carlaw stopped her and turned to Comethup. &ldquo;Can
you read?&rdquo; she asked, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; replied Comethup. &ldquo;The captain taught
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me one of those letters,&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw,
holding out her hand to the housekeeper. A letter was
handed to her, over the back of which she swiftly passed
her hand; she appeared to know in an instant from whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
it came, by the crest on the back, and even muttered the
name. This she handed to Comethup. &ldquo;Open it,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and read it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup opened it tremblingly, and floundered about
for a moment among the strange, cramped handwriting;
then blushingly confessed that he had not been used to
reading writing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not; very foolish of me to think you
would be able to,&rdquo; replied his aunt, taking the letter from
him. &ldquo;For the present we shall have to go on in the old
way, until you&rsquo;ve learned a little more, Comethup; and
then we&rsquo;ll dispense with everybody else for our private
matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The letters were opened by the housekeeper, and read
aloud, Miss Charlotte Carlaw making audible comments
upon them as the reading proceeded. Then a minute account
was given of all that had occurred in her absence&mdash;the
names of callers, and what they had said and what
messages they had left. When all was finished, and Miss
Carlaw had drunk her tea and had seen that Comethup
was also provided with refreshment, she gave orders that
all the servants in the place were to be brought to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every Jack and Jill of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; she exclaimed, emphatically;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something to say to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they were all wonderingly and somewhat sheepishly
assembled, she delivered herself, proudly and firmly,
of what she had made up her mind to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, just attend to me, all of you, for I&rsquo;m in deadly
earnest, and I mean to see that my orders are carried, out.
You see this young gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;she indicated Comethup,
who was seated beside her&mdash;&ldquo;this is Master Willis,
my nephew. For the future he takes a place in this
house, and wherever I may be, second only to mine. If
he says a thing is to be done, understand that it is to be
done; if he gives an order to any one of you, it must
be obeyed, as swiftly as though I had given it myself.
You needn&rsquo;t be alarmed, any of you; he&rsquo;s not the sort of
fellow to give any of you any trouble. But, trouble or
no trouble, you will understand he&rsquo;s the young master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
here, and the Lord help the man or the woman that
forgets it! You know me, or you should by this time,
and you know that, although I can&rsquo;t actually see you,
I know what you&rsquo;re doing, every one of you, by night or
by day. I know your tricks, and your humours, and your
little tempers, and all the rest of it; but we&rsquo;ll have no
tricks or humours or tempers with Master Willis. As I
say, you won&rsquo;t find him exacting; but what he wants he&rsquo;s
to have. That&rsquo;s all; I&rsquo;ve nothing more to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They appeared to understand very perfectly. One of
them&mdash;Comethup thought it was the butler&mdash;even stepped
forward and murmured a little incoherent speech, intended
to convey the loyalty of himself and his fellow-servants
to the young master. Miss Charlotte Carlaw
nodded approval, even punctuated the broken speech with
nods, and dismissed them all with a wave of her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you understand, Comethup,&rdquo; she said, turning
to the boy when they had gone, and putting her hand on
his shoulder, &ldquo;what your power here is. You&rsquo;ll find,
although I don&rsquo;t think you need the advice, that all the
money in the world won&rsquo;t enable you to hold that power
if you don&rsquo;t set about your life in the right way. If
you&rsquo;re peevish, or tyrannical, or unjust&mdash;well, you must
expect to get sour looks and unwilling service; if you
are a gentleman, and show that you only demand what is
your right, and demand it courteously&mdash;for servants are
human beings, and have their feelings&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be served
gladly and faithfully; at least that&rsquo;s what <i>I</i>&rsquo;ve found.
Now come with me, and I&rsquo;ll show you over the house,
and I&rsquo;ll show you your rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She appeared to know every inch of the great house,
from the lowest floor to the garret, telling him instantly
what each room was, even to the servants&rsquo; rooms. &ldquo;I
keep a butler and a housekeeper,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;but I
like to know everything myself, and what everybody is
doing. They used to think once they could cheat me
because I couldn&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em; but they found out their mistake
long since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was indeed a beautiful house, scrupulously kept,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
and very richly furnished. Rare pictures hung on the
walls, and wonderful china stood on shelves in cabinets;
and the tables and chairs and other articles of furniture
were many of them richly inlaid with rare and precious
woods. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any of these things, you know, Comethup;
I can only tell the shape of them, and I&rsquo;m a pretty
good judge in that way. But all these things are here
because it pleases me to think that I can afford to buy
them, and to delight other people&rsquo;s eyes with them, perhaps
even to make some of &rsquo;em a little envious. I was
born to have eyes, if ever any creature was, for I love
rich and beautiful things, even pictures. I&rsquo;ve got a man
who happens to be honest, and knows a good picture when
he sees one. When you&rsquo;ve grown older, and studied hard,
you&rsquo;ll know the value of all these things, Comethup, and
you&rsquo;ll be able to describe, in your own way, all the pictures
to me; and that will please us both. Now come
and look at your own rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two rooms which had been allotted to him seemed,
to his delighted eyes, the most beautiful in the house.
They were quite high up, and quite simply furnished; but
the windows of both looked out over the square, where all
the life and bustle that were so fascinating went on; and
each seemed to contain exactly everything that a boy
could possibly need. In the sitting room were pictures of
battle scenes, and deeds of daring generally, choice engravings
and etchings for the most part; and on the tables
and on shelves were numbers of books, beautifully bound,
whose very titles, as he glanced at them, gave promise of
the delights to be found within.</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Carlaw stood perfectly still, with her
hand upon his shoulder, until she heard his astonished
gasps; then she chuckled with satisfaction and marched
him through into the bedroom. Here a young man in a
sober brown suit was unpacking his box and carefully
arranging its contents in the wardrobe and in a huge
press that stood at one side of the room. He was a
round-faced, good-humoured-looking young man, and
Comethup liked his appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, is that you, Gwilt?&rdquo; cried Miss Carlaw. &ldquo;This
is your young master, Master Willis.&mdash;Comethup, Gwilt
will attend to you, and do everything you want&mdash;brush
your clothes and keep them in order, and assist you to
dress when necessary. He is your special servant, and
will have no other duties. Now tell me; do you like
these rooms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, just look round them, and tell me if you think
there&rsquo;s anything else you would like. What do you think
of the pictures? I got a man specially to choose them,
told him they must be bright, and just the sort of things
a boy would like; no sickly love-making, or cottage interiors,
or nonsense of that kind, but just a few with
some blood in &rsquo;em&mdash;fighting, and chopping up, and highwaymen,
and nice little delicacies of that kind. Like
&rsquo;em, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall ever get tired of looking at
them,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;And there are a heap of books
here, too, aunt&mdash;quite the most beautiful books I&rsquo;ve ever
seen,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;d forgotten the books. I wrote to a
bookseller to send me all he could think of that would be
likely to appeal to you&mdash;same style as the pictures, you
know. Now there isn&rsquo;t much time before dinner, so just
wash your hands, and come down to the drawing room
when you hear the first bell. I&rsquo;ll go and change my
frock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was going out of the room, with her stick moving
before her, when Comethup sprang to her side. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you let me&mdash;let me take you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>She understood in a moment, and her face lighted up
as she looked down at him. She did not merely put her
hand on his shoulder, as she had done before; she drew
it round his neck. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my dear boy!&rdquo; she said, almost
in a whisper.</p>

<p>He conducted her safely to the door of her room, and
then dashed upstairs again to his own. It was quite a
new sensation to have some one to attend on him, to anticipate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
his smallest wants, and be ready silently and respectfully
with each thing he required. The young man
was deft and quick, and seemed really proud of his young
charge; he even delicately turned him round for inspection
at the last moment, and smiled and nodded approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a tailor, and a bootmaker, and other people
a-coming to-morrow, sir; Miss Carlaw&rsquo;s orders, you know.
Miss Carlaw says as she&rsquo;ll be present for the measurin&rsquo;,
sir, so as to tell the men what she wants you to have, sir.
They&rsquo;ll be here at eleven in the morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; said Comethup, a little staggered
by the intelligence.</p>

<p>He found his aunt in the drawing room, pacing up and
down in her old fashion, with her black stick lightly
touching the carpet before her. Her hand upon his shoulder,
as they went into the dining room, reminded her of
the subject of his clothes; she moved her fingers over the
cloth impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll change all this, Comethup,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
told you we&rsquo;d dress you like a prince; we&rsquo;ll have a velvet
dinner suit for you. Lord! I&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em stare at you;
I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em something to talk about. They talk of their
brats to me, and the beauty of them, and the cleverness,
and the devil knows what; we&rsquo;ll outshine &rsquo;em all, Comethup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They dined in solemn state that evening, Comethup
sitting near his aunt at one end of the long table, with
the grave butler&mdash;who looked so very great and so awe-inspiring
that Comethup had felt a sudden inclination,
on entering the room, to bow to him&mdash;and some three or
four gigantic footmen in attendance. There were many
courses, and Comethup was considerably at a loss as to
how to manage, until he began to watch his aunt and to
do exactly as she did, after which he got on pretty well.</p>

<p>Soon after dinner she dismissed him, telling him that
she knew he must be tired, and that she should go soon
to bed herself. He kissed her, and, out of the fulness
of his heart, murmured a few grateful words to her; she
laughed and thrust him gently away, telling him, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
went out, to ring for his man if he wanted him. Comethup
was too full of the joy of those wondrous rooms of
his to want a stranger near him then; he rambled happily
about the rooms for some time, looking at the pictures,
and opening the books, and examining everything that
was to be examined. Finally he undressed and got into
bed and fell asleep, and dreamed that Gwilt had turned
suddenly into an ogre and swallowed all his clothes, so
that he could not get up, although his aunt was calling
him from the bottom of the stairs, and a perfect army
of servants were lined up and down the staircase, bowing
and waiting for him to pass.</p>

<p>He was awakened in the morning by Gwilt, who looked
anything but an ogre, with his fresh, cheerful, smiling
face, with the information that his bath was ready. He
was getting a little used by now to this wondrous change
in his fortunes, and to the fact that grown men and
women seemed to take a delight in ministering to the
needs of such a small and insignificant boy as himself.
He got through the day very well, passing through the
ordeal of being measured for an enormous quantity of
clothing, which he felt he should never under any circumstances
wear out, and noting with surprise how completely
his aunt seemed to understand exactly what she
wanted him to wear, and how unerringly she knew the
texture of cloth and velvet and laces by the mere touch of
those quick fingers of hers.</p>

<p>On this second day there were again no visitors, a
fact which Miss Carlaw explained to Comethup after the
servants had been dismissed and while she was drinking
her wine after dinner. &ldquo;You see, Comethup, I don&rsquo;t believe
in half-measures. I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to spring
you on them all at once, as it were, to show you forth in
all your glory. I&rsquo;m quite sure you&rsquo;re a handsome boy,
even as you are in your country clothes; but I&rsquo;m going to
make you look handsomer yet. By the Lord, I&rsquo;ll dazzle
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clothes began to arrive in an incredibly short
space of time, and in about a week from Comethup&rsquo;s first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
appearance in London his aunt informed him one morning
that a big dinner party was to be given that night at
which he was to be present. She was evidently very
anxious about the matter&mdash;so much so that she communicated
some of her anxiety to him, and it was an exciting
day for both of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people who are coming are chatterers, fools,
every one of &rsquo;em; but they&rsquo;re just the people we want
to give you a send-off and to blazon the whole thing
right and left. You shall be dressed like a prince to-night,
indeed; I&rsquo;ve given Gwilt his orders. And understand
that when you&rsquo;ve taken me to my set, <i>you</i> are to
take the one at the other end of the table; don&rsquo;t forget
that. You&rsquo;ve nothing to be frightened at, child; they&rsquo;ll
rally you, and tease you, some of &rsquo;em, but you&rsquo;ve only
got to be yourself, and to be quite simple and natural, and
I&rsquo;m sure I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t blush for you. There are two golden
rules for any one of the male sex entering society: one
is, that every man he meets is a fine fellow, worthy of his
admiration; and the other, that every woman, even if
she&rsquo;s ninety, and ugly as the devil, is a goddess to be
bowed before. Let him remember that always, and, by
the Lord! he&rsquo;ll be popular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup was dressed early that night, by his aunt&rsquo;s
instructions, in a soft, loose suit of brown velvet, with a
wide lace collar on his shoulders&mdash;lace of a value which
had made Comethup blink at the mere naming of the
price in his hearing. Deep lace ruffles fell over his small
hands, and he looked altogether a captivating little figure
as he joined his aunt in the drawing room, where she was
awaiting the arrival of her guests. She drew him toward
her and ran her hands quickly all over him, to assure
herself that everything was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had eyes to-night, child,&rdquo; she said, with a
little sigh. &ldquo;But I shall know what you look like by the
impression you create.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup only dimly remembered that evening afterward.
He knew that a great number of people came, all
very richly dressed, and most of the ladies blazing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
diamonds; that a number of the ladies went into raptures
over him, and that one of the gentlemen, who chuckled
tremendously at everything any one said, dubbed him
&ldquo;Prince Charming&rdquo;; that, seated at his end of the table,
with a gigantic footman standing behind him, he sent
every one within hearing into paroxysms of laughter by
returning what he thought were perfectly polite and
natural answers to questions which were asked him; that
Miss Carlaw leaned her head sideways to catch what was
said, and nodded and smiled, and was altogether immensely
delighted with the success her nephew was
achieving.</p>

<p>Indeed, the astute old lady made quite a mystery of
him; hinted at a romantic parentage, and refused to say
where she had discovered him, or anything about him.
She called him to her, as the ladies were leaving the room,
and put her arm about his neck and bent down and whispered:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonder, Comethup; I&rsquo;m very well
pleased with you, Prince Charming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His last sleepy recollection of that night was of standing
with his aunt in the hall, where she was bidding her
guests good-night, with the summer-night wind blowing
in upon them through the open door, and the lights of the
carriages outside, while every man gravely shook hands
with him, and every woman insisted on kissing him. He
wondered then what they would have thought if he had
suddenly saluted in the fashion the captain had taught
him. And with that thought he wondered what the
captain was doing then, and whether he had missed his
small boy friend.</p>

<p class="subheading">THE CAPTAIN SPEAKS HIS MIND.</p>


<p>If Miss Charlotte Carlaw, through all her strange life,
had lived for such pleasures as she might manage to
squeeze out of each day, with the aid of her wealth, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
may be said that with Comethup&rsquo;s appearance she began
to live for the gratification of her vanity in regard to the
boy. She was fiercely jealous of him&mdash;jealous almost of
any thought he gave to any one but herself; and yet she
was as jealous, on the other hand, for his success in attracting
notice, and in winning that very admiration the
expression of which aroused her jealousy. She was torn
always between two feelings in regard to him: she must
be first and everything in his life; and yet others must
worship him, and hold him, if possible, to be first in theirs.</p>

<p>It was a strange, unnatural life for a child. He saw
no one of his own age; he was waited on, at every hour of
the day, by bowing, obsequious men and women, to whom
often he would have been glad, but for the fear of his
aunt, to be on a more friendly footing, and to have
chatted naturally with; he met strange people, day after
day, who talked of things he could not understand; and,
despite all that was done for him, it must be confessed
that he was often desperately lonely.</p>

<p>Tutors had been provided for him, not only for elementary
subjects, but for music and painting and other
accomplishments. He had a passionate desire to learn,
to become a great and clever man, if it were possible,
although, of course, with the inconstancy of childhood, he
changed his ideas of a profession at least once in every
twenty-four hours. But of all the strange, unnatural
life he led, perhaps the strangest and most unnatural
times of all were some of the nights he spent with his
aunt&rsquo;s guests.</p>

<p>For it must be said at once that Miss Charlotte Carlaw
had not been dubbed eccentric for nothing. The one
passion of her life had been to be amused. A creature
of moods, subject to horrible fits of depression and melancholy,
she sought eagerly, and had sought all her days, for
something to keep her mind employed and to drive away
dulness. Her first dinner party had been highly respectable,
because it was necessary that Comethup should be
seen and valued by the best people; but some of the subsequent
ones were of a different order altogether.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Comethup thought that that second order of gathering
was a much more jolly function than the first&mdash;the
men were so very amusing and laughed so heartily, and
were such jovial good fellows, and the women were so
very, very pretty, and had such bright eyes. Then, too,
at those gatherings everybody seemed to talk at once and
to shout out the most extraordinary things, with roars of
laughter to accompany each speech or story. The stories
Comethup did not understand in the least, which perhaps
was well for him. Again, they had a delightful fashion,
both men and women, of calling each other by their
Christian names, which Comethup thought was very nice
and familiar, and saved a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>But it was after dinner that the real excitement of
the evening began, for the ladies&mdash;there were always a
less number of ladies than gentlemen&mdash;did not go into the
drawing room, as on the more formal occasions; they
stopped and chatted, while the gentlemen smoked. Indeed,
some of the ladies puffed a cigarette in the most
natural manner, quite as though they liked it, and then,
later on, they would all troop noisily into the drawing
room, Comethup and his aunt leading the way; and there
mysterious games were played.</p>

<p>To his utter astonishment, he discovered that his aunt
was a most wonderful card-player; she had the cards
pricked through, in some curious fashion, so that she
knew unerringly what each was by the lightest touch;
and she was said, by all who knew her, to be a most formidable
antagonist. Certainly she took the keenest delight
in every game, and staked largely. Indeed, they all
did that, and Comethup soon ceased to think with any
surprise of the sums which changed hands in one evening.</p>

<p>Then, too, there were other mysterious games played&mdash;some
on a green table with squares marked upon it&mdash;games
at which every one grew very eager indeed, and
some of them very silent. There were beautiful little
square cubes, with dots marked upon them, which were
shaken up in a silver-mounted box and turned out on a
table amid shouts and exclamations and mutterings; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
all the time, in every game, the money clinked and rattled
and changed about from one to the other.</p>

<p>One night Miss Carlaw suddenly called out his name,
and he went to her. &ldquo;Here, we can&rsquo;t have Prince Charming
standing about looking at others playing. He&rsquo;s the
master here, and, by the Lord! he shall play himself.
Turn out your pockets; let&rsquo;s see what money you&rsquo;ve got.
I have had the devil&rsquo;s own luck to-night, and perhaps
you&rsquo;ll be able to fleece some of these good folk too. Turn
out your pockets, you rascal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy did as he was told, and she counted it rapidly
over, touching each piece with her fingers. Then she
took some coins from a pile of gold and silver before
her and added it to Comethup&rsquo;s stock, and thrust the
whole lot in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, take that and sit down here. If you&rsquo;re
sharp you&rsquo;ll soon get into the way of it; and if any of
these people take advantage of your youth and innocence,
I&rsquo;ll be the death of them. Now, boys and girls, on we
go again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup, child though he was, soon got into the excitement
of the thing. With promptings from the others,
he learned what to do and what to say, and, fortune favouring
him, he went to his room that night with his
stock of money still further increased. Altogether, he
thought it was rather a glorious business, and couldn&rsquo;t
quite understand why some of the men wore sour looks
when they went away.</p>

<p>It became quite a regular thing for the child to take
his place among those excited, eager gamblers. Time
after time he went to bed in the small hours of the morning,
sometimes so worn out that he was glad to let the
sympathetic Gwilt undress him and lift him into bed.
Sometimes he made horrible blunders with the cards and
lost heavily; sometimes he won. But, under any circumstances,
it did not affect him, for his aunt was careful
to see that he always had plenty of money.</p>

<p>They drove out nearly every day, and seemed to spend
a great part of their time in shops. Miss Charlotte Carlaw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
had a perfect passion for buying. Anything that was
pointed out to her, and of which she approved, or anything
that the boy noticed, was bought at once. She encouraged
Comethup to spend his money royally, and never
hesitated for an instant about anything she thought he
would like, however costly it might be. The whirl and
the excitement and the intoxication of the new life were
upon him, so that he had but little time for thought; yet
sometimes he found his thoughts straying back to the simple
life in the old town, which seemed all so very far away,
and to the simple people he had known and loved there.
He ventured to approach his aunt on the subject one day
when they were alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt, I&rsquo;ve been thinking&mdash;about the captain,&rdquo; he began
timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What captain?&rdquo; she asked sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>The</i> captain&mdash;Captain Garraway-Kyle. You remember
he was very kind to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! So you&rsquo;re getting tired of me, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t
think that. But I&rsquo;ve thought of the captain very often,
and I shouldn&rsquo;t like him to think that I&rsquo;d forgotten him.
Besides, you asked him to come and see me yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Comethup, quite right. I&rsquo;m a foolish
old woman, and you&rsquo;re a good fellow not to forget your
old friend. Write to him to-night, and ask him to come
here and stay as long as he likes. Tell him to let you
know by what train he is coming, and on what day, and
you can drive down to the station to meet him. Will that
satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup thanked her gratefully, and wrote to the
captain within the hour, begging him to come to town
at the earliest possible moment and to stay as long as he
could. He wrote the letter very carefully, and scanned it
anxiously afterward; but finally sent it, and began to
count the hours before a reply could be received. He began,
too, to arrange what should be done for the captain&rsquo;s
entertainment when he arrived.</p>

<p>Two days elapsed, and then there came a letter addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
to Master Comethup Willis in a small, stiff,
rather cramped handwriting. The letter was brought to
him while he sat at breakfast with his aunt; he tore it
open eagerly, and exclaimed at once, &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s coming,
he&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The captain?&rdquo; inquired his aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He writes very nicely. He says he will be most&mdash;where
is it?&mdash;oh, he says he&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;most delighted to
accept, and will come on Thursday&rsquo;; that&rsquo;s to-morrow.
He&rsquo;s very particular; he&rsquo;s written quite plainly the name
of the station, and the time the train arrives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, order the carriage, and go down to meet him.
And don&rsquo;t forget you&rsquo;re to give him a good time while
he&rsquo;s in London; if you think he&rsquo;d like to go to any particular
place, take him there. You ought to know by
this time that you can do as you like in those matters.
Besides, I want the captain to understand who Prince
Charming is, and what position he takes. You&rsquo;d better
interview Mrs. Currie, and tell her a gentleman is coming
to stay with you, and that she is to make arrangements
about his room. Give your orders, Prince Charming,
give your orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It happened that on the day fixed for the captain&rsquo;s
arrival a dinner party had been arranged at Miss Charlotte
Carlaw&rsquo;s house&mdash;a dinner party of the more riotous
kind. The captain had decided upon so late a train that
he reached London but little before the dinner hour.
Comethup, who was to play his usual part in the festivities,
had to be dressed in all his glory before setting out
for the station; there would have been no time for dressing
afterward. Thus it happened that the simple old
gentleman, stepping out of the railway carriage in the
dusk of an autumn evening, was confronted by a gaily
dressed little figure in the costume, on a miniature scale,
of a gallant of the days of Charles I, with plumed hat
and lace ruffles and everything complete. Beside this
figure stood a tall footman.</p>

<p>The captain had some difficulty in recognising his
young friend, and, even when he did so, he did not appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
to be quite at his ease. The footman who took his small
portmanteau from his hand evidently overawed him; it
is impossible to say what dream the captain had had as
he travelled to town, but it is certain that he had not
expected to meet the child in this fashion.</p>

<p>Comethup got into the carriage, and it was only then
that they really began to talk to each other. Comethup
had slipped one hand timidly into the captain&rsquo;s and the
captain&rsquo;s fingers had closed over it; the man looked down
at the child beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, little friend!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; said Comethup, with a deep sigh of content,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know how glad I am to see you! It
seemed such a long time before your letter came; I
thought all sorts of horrible things must have happened&mdash;that
you had gone away&mdash;or&mdash;or anything. But it&rsquo;s all
right now, and I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, Comethup, that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; murmured the
captain, more moved than he cared to show. &ldquo;This is
quite a holiday for me, and we must make the most of
it, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we&rsquo;ve arranged lots of things for you, so
as to give you what aunt calls a good time while you&rsquo;re in
London. There&rsquo;s a dinner party to-night&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I
was obliged to come looking such a swell, as aunt calls it;
I didn&rsquo;t mean to come to meet you like this, you know,
but there wouldn&rsquo;t have been time to dress after I got
back&mdash;and a lot of nice people are coming; you <i>will</i> enjoy
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure
I don&rsquo;t mind you&rsquo;re being a swell in the least, Comethup.
I suppose,&rdquo; he added, a little wistfully, &ldquo;I suppose your
aunt is very good to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup nodded and laughed. &ldquo;There never was
anybody half so good&mdash;except you, sir, of course. She
gives me everything I want, and some things that I scarcely
want at all. It&rsquo;s really quite wonderful; I really didn&rsquo;t
think anybody could have so much money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re quite happy?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;yes,&rdquo; replied Comethup, after turning the matter
over in his mind for a moment. &ldquo;You see, I can&rsquo;t help
thinking sometimes about you, and &rsquo;Linda, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that reminds me,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I saw
&rsquo;Linda to-day, and told her I was coming to see you. She
sends her love to you; I think she would have liked to
come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The carriage drew up at the house, and the captain
alighted. He held himself very erect, shabby little figure
that he was, as he went up the steps and into the house.
He was conducted at once to the room which had been
set apart for him, and presently made his appearance in
the drawing room, where quite a number of people had
already assembled, and approached Miss Carlaw. She
stood, as usual, with her hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder. She
seemed to know the captain&rsquo;s step at once, and greeted
him cordially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, captain, so you&rsquo;ve really come to see how
Prince Charming likes his kingdom? What do you think
of him now, eh? Are you prepared, like every other Jack
and Jill, to prostrate yourself and worship? What do
you think of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he looks&mdash;looks very well,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s reason to be,&rdquo; she retorted, with a little note
of defiance in her voice. &ldquo;Prince Charming knows he&rsquo;s
only got to clap his hands, and his foolish old fairy godmother
will get whatever he wants, if it&rsquo;s to come from
the other end of the world. Oh, we do things properly
here, I&rsquo;ll warrant you, sir&mdash;don&rsquo;t we, my prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup took his usual place at table, at the opposite
end to his aunt, and had the captain at his right hand.
The boy, young as he was, could not but remark to himself
what an incongruous figure the captain cut in that assembly;
his quiet, delicate, old-world face and manner contrasted
so strongly with the faces about him; his dress,
perfectly neat though it was, seemed to belong to a bygone
day when compared with theirs. Once or twice, too,
when things were said and stories told which Comethup
did not understand, the captain was the only one who did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
not laugh; indeed, he stiffened a little in his chair, and
once laid his hand upon Comethup&rsquo;s, where it rested on
the table, and pressed it slightly, as though in sympathy.</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Carlaw had been in a strange mood all
the evening, had told her wildest stories, had laughed
more loudly than any of her guests. After the men had
lighted their cigars and cigarettes, and some of the
women had begun also to smoke, she suddenly clapped her
hands and cried out: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Prince Charming?&mdash;Come
here, you dog, I want you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain, watching her after the boy had run to
her, saw her with her arm about him, whispering something
to him, insisting upon something; the child was
hanging back and blushing, and pleading with her, also
in a whisper. At last he laughed, and appeared to consent.
She clasped her hands again, and cried for silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence for Prince Charming! Boys and girls, you
have not yet learned all our prince&rsquo;s accomplishments.
He can play like a born gambler; he can whisper a pretty
speech in a lady&rsquo;s ear; now you shall hear him sing. Oh,
you need not be afraid; he has lessons daily from one
of the best masters.&mdash;Come, up with you, Comethup!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the men caught him up and put him on the
table just in front of his aunt; she held one of his legs,
so that he might not overbalance. One of the ladies ran
to the piano and played a few notes, and then Comethup,
very timidly at first, but more boldly as he went on, sang
his song.</p>

<p>It was a foolish thing for a child to sing under any
circumstances&mdash;a riotous chant of drinking, and women&rsquo;s
eyes, and red lips, and what not; but it had a rousing refrain,
and after he had sung it once, they all stood up,
shouting, with their glasses in their hands, and roared it
all over again. Comethup, for his part, seemed to see
none of them; he sang with all his might and main and
put his heart into the wretched ditty, and he sang to
the captain. And the captain sat still, with his head
resting on his hand, and watched him.</p>

<p>The uproar as he finished was deafening, and as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
trooped into the drawing room two of the men carried
him shoulder-high between them, and some one started to
sing, &ldquo;For he&rsquo;s a jolly good fellow.&rdquo; It was taken up
by them all except, perhaps, by the captain, who walked
quietly along in the rear.</p>

<p>The cards and dice were got out at once, and Miss
Carlaw plunged into the game. Comethup had slipped
away, and had stolen over to where the captain sat apart;
he drew near him, and the old man put his arm about
him and held him close, without speaking. Presently,
however, Miss Carlaw remembered the boy, and stopped
her game to call aloud for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Comethup? He&rsquo;s been winning people&rsquo;s
money all the week, now he&rsquo;s got to give them a chance of
revenge.&mdash;A man can&rsquo;t slink away with full pockets, you
know, Prince Charming. Where are you? Come and
take a hand here at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy rose obediently, and the captain rose with
him. Indeed, the captain walked with him to Miss Carlaw&rsquo;s
side, and then ventured to interpose, in a low voice,
&ldquo;You surely do not let this child play, madam, and for
money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned her face up to him, with a frown upon
it. &ldquo;And why not, pray? He&rsquo;s got money enough
and to spare; let him win or lose as he will. Don&rsquo;t
spoil sport, captain; sit down, and take a hand yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; I am but a poor gentleman, and have nothing
to lose; it is as well to be frank on such matters.&rdquo; He
turned and walked back to his former place, changed his
mind, and came back to watch the child play.</p>

<p>Comethup was in luck that night; more than once
Miss Carlaw patted his shoulder approvingly when the
money was pushed toward him. When at last play was
finished, and the guests had departed, the captain lingered
a little uneasily, glancing once or twice at the old woman,
as though he wished to speak. Perhaps she guessed his
intention, for she kept her hand obstinately on Comethup&rsquo;s
shoulder and said pointedly: &ldquo;Well, I suppose we&rsquo;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
all tired, and had better get to bed.&mdash;Why, you&rsquo;re quite
sleepy, Prince Charming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain raised his head. &ldquo;If you would spare me
a matter of five minutes, madam, I should be glad. There
is something I wish to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, at this time of night? Won&rsquo;t it keep till
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; replied the captain, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like a man&mdash;so devilish unreasonable! Very
well, let&rsquo;s have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not before the child,&rdquo; said the captain, in the same
tone as before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! You seem determined to have your own way,
so I suppose I must humour you. If I fall asleep, don&rsquo;t
accuse me of rudeness.&mdash;Prince Charming, go to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup, wondering a little, kissed his aunt and
gravely shook hands with the captain. When he had gone,
and the door was closed, Miss Carlaw seated herself,
rested her hands on the top of her stick and her chin
on her hands, and waited for the captain to begin. He
seemed somewhat at a loss, and paced about nervously
for a few moments before speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Carlaw, what I am&mdash;about to say&mdash;may appear&mdash;I
fear it must&mdash;in the light of an impertinence. I know
that I have no right to say anything, no right to interfere;
but I happen, lonely old fellow though I am, to have
a great affection for this child you have so generously
taken under your care.&rdquo; The captain paused for a moment
and then swung round and spoke almost fiercely,
&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, madam, what are you making of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw, in a tone of approval.
&ldquo;I like a man to come to the point and hit out
straight. So you want to know what I&rsquo;m making of him,
do you?&rdquo; She started up from her chair, and advanced
toward the captain threateningly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, sir.
I&rsquo;m making a gentleman of him; I&rsquo;m showing him what
the world is like, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst side of the world, madam,&rdquo; said the captain,
indignantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough for me,&rdquo; she retorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be; you are a woman of the world, and
can choose for yourself. This child is helpless; his fresh
young mind can take in everything he sees about him.
You stand at the present moment as everything to him&mdash;his
benefactress, almost his goddess. What you do must
be right, simply because you do it. You told me just
now that you were training this boy to be a gentleman;
I tell you, madam, you are training him to be a blackguard,
and probably worse, if there is anything worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Carlaw had stopped, and was listening intently.
Her brows were drawn down, but she nodded sternly as
the captain finished speaking. &ldquo;Go on, sir,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known this boy, madam, since he was a baby&mdash;he&rsquo;s
little more than a baby now&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve never found
a sweeter, cleaner, purer soul on this muddy old earth of
ours yet. He turns naturally to sweet things, to everything
that has the sunlight and free air upon it; he&rsquo;s as
clear as crystal. Think of his age, madam! Is it an age
when he should be mixing with men and women&mdash;forgive
the discourtesy, I beg of you&mdash;with men and women not
too choice in their conversation or their manners? Is it
an age when he should be gambling and tossing gold
about at an hour when he should be in bed? Believe me,
I do not stand before you as a prig, or as one who would
have a word to say against anything in its proper place
or its proper season; you choose your own guests, and
your choice is doubtless a right one, for every man and
every woman chooses in this world according to his or her
need. But with this boy&mdash;this baby&mdash;it&rsquo;s different. His
soul is in your hands, to do what you will with it. And
I say, frankly, madam, that you are doing with it badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not speak; she turned about, and went to her
chair and sat down in the same attitude as before, except
that she rested her forehead on her hands instead
of her chin. After a pause the captain spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust&mdash;I beg that you will forgive me if anything
I have said appears harsh. I am not used to women&rsquo;s
ways, and have been but little in their society, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
have spoken out of the depths of my heart. It hurt me
when the child left me, but I was glad, for his sake, and
I readily recognise the unstinted generosity you appear
to display toward him. But, madam, I entreat you to remember
not only the child, but the man who is growing
up under your hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat for a long time in the same attitude, and
when, presently, she raised her head and spoke, he saw
with contrition that her lips were quivering; she even
stretched one hand toward him for a moment, as though
to ask his pardon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good man,&rdquo; she said, in a curiously altered
voice. &ldquo;And I am&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m a wicked old fool. I&rsquo;ve
been treating this child like a toy, holding him before all
my friends, that they might see what a beautiful thing
I had managed to secure. Friends, indeed!&rdquo; she cried,
fiercely, getting up and beginning to pace about, &ldquo;there
isn&rsquo;t one of them I care a brass farthing for; there isn&rsquo;t
one of them I wouldn&rsquo;t show the door to-morrow. Oh,
you&rsquo;re right; you&rsquo;re very right, and I&rsquo;m a monster. I&rsquo;ve
been given this glorious thing from God, and I don&rsquo;t even
know how to take care of it. Captain, I&rsquo;m sorry to think,
from what I know of the world, that there are very few
men who would have been brave enough to say what you
have said to-night. But there&rsquo;s a Providence in your
coming&mdash;a Providence that set the boy longing to see
you. I&mdash;I am more glad than I can say that you came
here. I&rsquo;ve been blind&mdash;blind in two senses&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll end
it. By the Lord! I&rsquo;ll make this boy what you say he
should be; he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t minister to my whims any longer.&rdquo;
She began to laugh, and shook her head at him whimsically.
&ldquo;Oh, I like you; it&rsquo;s refreshing to meet a man like
you occasionally&mdash;you&rsquo;re precious rare. By George! you
did more for the boy than I did, and knew more about
him&mdash;upon my word you did. Oh, I&rsquo;ll be good to him,
I&rsquo;ll be proud of him. I want&mdash;I want to think about all
this; and then I&rsquo;ll talk to you about what&rsquo;s best to be
done for him. Give me your hand. Will you promise to
stay here a week at least&mdash;now, I&rsquo;ll take no denial&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
week at least? It&rsquo;ll make the boy happy, and it&rsquo;ll do
him good, and it&rsquo;ll take him away from me, which&rsquo;ll do
him good too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t stay,&rdquo; said the captain, with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll do what we
can with him together. Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid; I
haven&rsquo;t spoiled him yet. But you&rsquo;ve got to advise me
what to do. It&rsquo;s evident, although it hurts me to say it,
that I&rsquo;m no good at the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the captain remained in town for a week, while
Comethup&rsquo;s fate was decided. Long discussions were
held late at night, after he had gone to bed, between Miss
Carlaw and his earlier friend. During the day the boy,
blissfully unconscious of any change being contemplated,
drove about with the captain and his aunt to every conceivable
quarter of London, in the frantic desire to give
the captain what he called &ldquo;a good time.&rdquo; It often happened
that they drifted, quite naturally, toward one of
the large barracks, or down to the Horse Guards, where
the captain cocked his head knowingly and became at
once, in the eyes of his admiring young friend, an expert;
indeed, the mere passing of a soldier in the streets
stiffened the little old gentleman&rsquo;s figure and gave a
sternness to his eyes, which showed, Comethup thought,
that he ought really to have been a very great and very
wonderful general indeed.</p>

<p>No more dinner parties were given during that week;
but once or twice the three, after dining together, went
to a theatre, Miss Carlaw appearing to understand the
play, whatever it might be, quite as clearly as her companions.
She had a wonderful faculty for locating a
voice; and when once Comethup, in a rapid whisper, had
explained to her what the scene was, she appeared to know
exactly where each particular character came on, and how
he or she moved about, and when they made their exits.
It was truly wonderful, and Comethup lost a great part
of the real business of the stage by watching her eager,
listening face, and wondering that the loss of her eyes
was really so little of a loss after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s visit was drawing to a close when one
evening after dinner Miss Carlaw turned to him and
waved a hand toward the boy, and said abruptly, &ldquo;Now
tell him all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup looked from one to the other, while the
captain cleared his throat and coughed, flushed a little,
and drew himself up in his chair. Miss Carlaw waited
impatiently, lightly tapping her fingers on the table before
her. At last the captain spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must know, Comethup, that your aunt, Miss
Carlaw&rdquo;&mdash;he bowed with much ceremony toward that
lady&mdash;&ldquo;your aunt has been good enough to ask my advice,
and to place some confidence in me, in regard to your
future. Of course, Comethup, I need hardly say that she
is far more competent than I can hope to be to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; ejaculated Miss Carlaw, shaking her head
vigorously. &ldquo;But go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To put the matter briefly, my dear boy, your aunt
feels that there is not only a time for play but a time for
work. We are both very proud of you; we hope to be
prouder still. No man can do anything in this world unless
he learns to work; unless he learns to fight his way
with others, and find out what the world is like, and learn
some of its lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well put, captain, excellently put,&rdquo; interrupted Miss
Carlaw again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To come to the point, Comethup, your aunt thinks
that it would be wiser for you to mix with boys of your
own age, and she intends to send you to school. She has
already selected a good school, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And look here, Prince Charming,&rdquo; broke in the old
woman, &ldquo;I think I know my boy well enough by this time
to know that he&rsquo;ll do whatever we think best, for his own
sake as well as for ours. The captain here has told you
very prettily why we think it&rsquo;s necessary; just let me say
that if you don&rsquo;t like it when you get there, you can just
come straight back again. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re brave enough
to like it, and to make the best of it, although you&rsquo;re
only a little chap. And you shall come to me every holiday&mdash;oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
they&rsquo;ve got precious long holidays, I can tell
you&mdash;and you shall see the captain whenever you like.
This school is only a few miles from your old home, and
is right close to the sea. Of course I don&rsquo;t know, but I
should think it&rsquo;s extremely likely that our good friend
here might find time to run over to see you occasionally
on half holidays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most assuredly,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you say to it all?&rdquo; inquired Miss
Carlaw.</p>

<p>Comethup&rsquo;s heart had been beating a little faster than
usual while they spoke; but the prospect was really more
alluring than they thought, and the pill they desired him
to swallow needed no gilding, for the boy&rsquo;s life had
been recently an unnatural one&mdash;strange and wonderful,
but still unnatural; and the prospect of meeting boys of
his own age, the greater prospect of learning something,
and becoming a clever man, made his heart leap indeed.
Then, too, the thought of frequently meeting the captain,
of being within but a few miles of him, was attractive;
he could scarcely hope for better fortune. After a pause
he said slowly: &ldquo;Of course, I should like to go to school,
and&mdash;and learn; and it would be nice to see the captain,
and to come back to you for the holidays. I&rsquo;m quite sure
I should like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Carlaw clapped her hands and smiled. The captain
nodded at the boy approvingly. &ldquo;I knew just what
he&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Carlaw.&mdash;&ldquo;Come here, Prince
Charming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy slipped down from his seat and went to her
side. She drew her arm about him and said, with a tenderness
that was strange to her: &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t think,
Comethup, that I want to get rid of you&mdash;God forbid!
But you&rsquo;re all I have in the world, all I&rsquo;ve got to think of
or to be proud of. And I want you to be a clever man;
I want to be able to point to you and say: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my
boy; match him if you can!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what I want to
think. And so you&rsquo;ll work hard and grow fast, and this
foolish old aunt of yours will wait at home in patience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
until you come back to her.&rdquo; Her voice had fallen almost
to a whisper, and he felt her lips lightly touch his
hair before she pushed him gently from her.</p>

<p>The final details were arranged on the morrow, not
without conflicts between Miss Carlaw and the captain.
The old lady would have sent the boy to school dressed as
a prince; the captain was for plain clothes in order that
there might be no distinction between him and his fellows,
and the captain had his way. The next serious
point of difference was on the question of pocket money,
Miss Carlaw having firmly made up her mind that the boy
must be possessed of no less a sum than a sovereign a
week, and the captain urging that a half-crown would be
more than he possibly could spend. The two worthy
creatures came to high words over the matter, and finally
arrived at a compromise: Comethup was to have five shillings
a week, and the captain exacted a promise from Miss
Carlaw that this was not to be supplemented by any additional
sum, at all events for the present.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that the captain was to accompany
the boy to the school and see him safely established
there; it was scarcely necessary for Miss Carlaw to go,
when the place was really almost on the captain&rsquo;s road
home. The captain, proud of having got his own way in
the matter, and prouder still of his mission, was very particular
in discussing matters with the principal of the
school about the airing of beds and the arrangements
generally for the boy&rsquo;s comfort; quite gave himself airs,
in a gentlemanly fashion, over the matter. But when it
was all done and the two had parted at the school gate,
and the captain had watched the figure of the child going
back slowly across the deserted playground to his new
life, the little gentleman drooped a little, and was not
so cheery or confident as he had been; lingered about so
long, indeed, near the gate, that he nearly lost the last
train to the dull little town in which he lived, and had to
make a run for it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="subheading">A RETROSPECT&mdash;AND A FLUTTERING OF HEARTS.</p>


<p>Comethup Willis had passed his sixteenth birthday,
and could afford to smile, with something of complacency,
at the thought of that small and trembling boy who, eight
long years before, had parted from the captain at the
school gate on a certain summer evening. Yet, looking
back over the years themselves, though they had been
long in the going, the span of them seemed not so great
after all. Comethup thought, with a comfortable sigh
of content, what happy years they had been; what a wonderful
time of close, strong friendships, and boyish vows
of faithfulness; what days of work and play, and strong
and vigorous life; what nights of perfect, dreamless sleep!</p>

<p>It had indeed been a happy time; he wondered, in his
grateful heart, if ever boy had been so blessed before.
The school had been a good and healthy one&mdash;a place
where a boy was taught to work hard and to play harder;
and Comethup, in the atmosphere of it, had grown into a
tall, straight-limbed lad, with a strength about him which
his dreamy face and slow, quiet smile belied.</p>

<p>He sat on a seat in the playground, with his head leaning
against the trunk of a tree, and dreamily watched the
boys at play, and thought about the eight years that had
slipped so peacefully by. To-morrow was to be his last
day at school; to-morrow the captain was coming, quite
early in the morning, and they were going away together
in the evening. The captain always came early on great
match days; and to-morrow was a great match day, and
Comethup was to play for the school for the last time.</p>

<p>Comethup thought of the captain with tenderness;
remembered his many visits to the school, and the keen
delight he had taken in his young friend&rsquo;s progress. Was
it not the captain who had been present on that memorable
occasion when Comethup Willis made his first century?
That was two years ago, before the boy had shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
signs of growing to his present height. It is a matter for
doubt as to which of them&mdash;the captain or Comethup&mdash;trembled
the most on that occasion. It had been one of
those disastrous days, from the schoolboy&rsquo;s standpoint,
when luck had gone clean against them; when unfeeling
rivals had bowled balls and manipulated catches in a
manner which appeared to leave no hope of victory.
Comethup had gone in last but one, and it was the first
great match he had played in. He remembered now, as
though it were yesterday, how he had seemed to see a
crowd of faces in a great square about him, and here and
there a little patch of colour from a lady&rsquo;s dress; remembered,
too, how he had passed the captain on his way
to the wicket, and of how the captain, in a trembling
voice, had whispered to him huskily to save the day. As
he bent over his bat for a moment he murmured a prayer&mdash;for
which he may surely be forgiven&mdash;that God would
let him save the day and please the captain.</p>

<p>His heart leaped a little, even now, at the thought of
that day; at the thought of how he managed to get most
of the bowling, while the other batsmen &ldquo;kept his end
up&rdquo;; of the cheering, frantic crowd of boys as he hit as
he had never hit before&mdash;as one inspired, indeed&mdash;while
the score crept steadily up on the board; of the wild
tumult when the hit was made which assured them of
victory; of the carrying out of his bat, while a score of
youngsters struggled for the honour of bearing him
shoulder-high to the tent. He remembered it all perfectly,
and smiled at the recollection; smiled, too, to
think how the captain had marched proudly in front
while the boy was carried along; and of how, when he
grasped Comethup&rsquo;s hand, there had been tears in the
little gentleman&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>In everything that had happened in his school life the
captain seemed to have taken a prominent place. There
was scarcely a boy in the great school who did not know
him&mdash;scarcely one, indeed, with whose name he was not
familiar. Nearly every half-holiday had seen his erect
figure turn in at the gates, and his quick eyes, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
gray eyebrows, look about in search for Comethup. On
summer days, when the cricket field was dotted with
white fingers and the pleasant click of bat against ball
was heard in the drowsy afternoon, the captain was there,
and never a stroke, good or bad, escaped him; on winter
days, when the snow was deep and boys were blowing on
cold fingers, and the sharp cries and shouts of the sliders
cut keenly through the frosty air, there was the captain
again, buttoned to the chin, clapping his gloved hands
furiously, and laughing with the best of them. He had
become, in time, quite an institution, and may be said to
have again considerably renewed his youth, in that place
where youth was monarch of all.</p>

<p>And to-morrow was to end it; to-morrow the last farewells
must be said, and he would go away, appropriately
enough, with the captain. It had been arranged that he
was to stay for a week with the captain in the place of
his birth before going on to London to join his aunt;
after that the plans for him were indefinite.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, during all the years of his school
life he had never once visited the old town; something
had always occurred to prevent his doing so. It was but
a few miles distant from the sea; but the captain had
visited him so frequently, and was always to be expected
on half-holidays; and his own holidays were spent, from
start to finish, with his aunt in London, so that he really
had had no opportunity of going back to the old place.
But now the captain had begged him to spend a week at
his cottage, and Comethup, after consulting Miss Carlaw,
had gladly accepted.</p>

<p>The boy had heard frequently, through the captain, of
the welfare of those in whom he was interested. Not
having seen them since he had been a child himself, it was
difficult to realize that changes could have taken place,
or that others, as well as himself, must have grown older.
He thought of &rsquo;Linda still as a little child wandering in
the garden among the drifting leaves and under the
whispering trees; saw Medmer Theed, the shoemaker,
hammering away at his work, without an additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
wrinkle; was forced to believe, in a vague fashion, that
Brian must have grown, because he himself had grown,
and Brian was certainly older. The captain had shaken
his head more than once at the mention of Brian&rsquo;s name,
and hinted that father and son did not pull well together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the lad&rsquo;s fault, you know, Comethup,&rdquo; he had
said, &ldquo;although I never liked the boy. But Robert Carlaw
ought never to have been a father&mdash;ought never to
have been anything, for the matter of that. And yet the
boy&rsquo;s clever, I&rsquo;m told; but it&rsquo;s a cleverness, an infernal
smartness, I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The afternoon wore away, and Comethup was roused
from his reverie by the clanging of the bell summoning
the boys to roll-call. He got up lazily and stretched
himself, and suddenly saw a small boy standing before
him, panting and eager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willis, there&rsquo;s some one to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See me? Where?&rdquo; He thought at first that it
might be the captain, who had not been able to wait
longer, in his eagerness for the morrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out by the gate there,&rdquo; said the small boy, pointing
behind him. &ldquo;A man&mdash;a young man. Asked me to find
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; cried Comethup, and went leaping and
striding toward the gate. There seemed to be no one
there at first, until he went out a pace or two into the
road; and there, leaning easily with his back against the
wall, was a young man smoking a cigarette. &ldquo;Did you
want to see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Comethup; and then, as the
young man turned quickly, the boy stopped, and looked
at him with a puzzled expression for a moment; as the
other smiled and threw back his head, Comethup gasped
out, &ldquo;Why&mdash;it&rsquo;s Brian!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian nodded, and stepped forward and shook Comethup
by the hand. It was the first time they had met
since Comethup had left the old place with his aunt; yet
there were things about this tall, handsome fellow of
eighteen that were the things he had known in the Brian
who had been a child. It was the same smile that broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
over his face suddenly, like light; the dark eyes, that
seemed to see so much farther and so much more than
any other eyes; the brown hair, waving back from his
forehead, and worn rather long; the slightly swaggering
fashion of carrying himself&mdash;the fashion which his father
had carried to an excess. There were, besides all this, a
carelessness of dress and a recklessness of manner that
seemed to be a part of his natural growth, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s Brian. I thought I might be able to see
you. By Jove! you haven&rsquo;t altered a bit, my cousin of
the queer name. Of course you&rsquo;re bigger, but you&rsquo;ve still
got that angelic face and that maiden air of goodness.
I&rsquo;ll put you into a poem some day, only no one will believe
I&rsquo;ve drawn you from life. There, let&rsquo;s stop jesting;
I want you to help me. The truth of the matter is,
there&rsquo;s been a kick-up between my father and myself; we
never did hit it; his ways are not my ways, and he&rsquo;s a
blackguard, and not with my sort of blackguardism
either.&rdquo; He laughed, and clapped a hand on Comethup&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;Look here, old boy, I&rsquo;m not envying you the
plums of life you&rsquo;ve got, but I want&mdash;oh, I have the
right, as far as that goes&mdash;I want you to help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; began Comethup, &ldquo;if I can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do everything. According to my father,
you stole my birthright from me, you rascal, although
that wasn&rsquo;t your fault. Some of us get the bread in this
world, and the others, for all the asking, get the stone.
Let&rsquo;s cut all this and come to the point. I&rsquo;m going to
London; it&rsquo;s the only place where a man with brains&mdash;and
I <i>am</i> a man now, although I am only eighteen, and
I know I&rsquo;ve got the brains&mdash;it&rsquo;s the only place where a
man can do anything, or show what stuff is in him. In
the country, among these grinning, slow, dead-and-alive
yokels, one can&rsquo;t move; one seems to get stuck in their
beastly clayey soil, and to take root there and never to
move again. London&rsquo;s the place; I saw it once when I
was a boy; I&rsquo;ve dreamed of it ever since. I know what
I can do there; I&rsquo;ll make men recognise me. But I&rsquo;m a
beggar, so far as money is concerned, and I&rsquo;m heavily in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
debt. I don&rsquo;t care a hang about the debts; dad&rsquo;ll have
to pay them; that was what the row was about. However,
it&rsquo;s his own fault, and in any case it doesn&rsquo;t matter
now. What I want to know is this: can you let me have
enough money to take me to London, and give me a
bit over until I find my feet? I know you&rsquo;ve got plenty,
and I don&rsquo;t know any one else to whom I can turn. I knew
you were here, because I saw the captain&mdash;that old
starched chap&mdash;a day or two back, and he told me where
you were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gladly help you,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;How much
money do you want? I am afraid I haven&rsquo;t very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, have you got five pounds you can spare?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it happened that within the past year Miss
Charlotte Carlaw, in the pride of her heart, had been in
the habit of breaking her promise to the captain and forwarding
sums of money to Comethup whenever she could
find an excuse for so doing&mdash;whenever, for instance, he
had made a big score at cricket, or had written her a
letter with which she was particularly pleased. Moreover,
as every bill&mdash;and they were not many&mdash;which he
contracted was promptly paid, without question, by his
aunt, he found it somewhat difficult, as a mere schoolboy,
to get rid of all the money he had, although it seemed to
slip through his fingers pretty quickly. Only on the previous
day Miss Carlaw had sent him twenty pounds in
bank notes, with a message to the effect that, as he was
visiting the captain, he would probably want some money
to spend, and ten pounds was for that; and, as he was
now a gentleman at large and his school days were left
behind, he would want some further money in his pocket,
and ten pounds was for that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think five pounds is much good to you,&rdquo; said
Comethup. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better take ten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; exclaimed Brian, with much alacrity.
&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t the least idea you&rsquo;d got so much. By George!
I shall be a millionaire; ten pounds will last a deuce of a
long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup put his hand into his pocket and produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the money. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it would
be better for you to go and see my aunt&mdash;<i>your</i> aunt, too,
you know&mdash;and tell her what you mean to do? She&rsquo;s
awfully good, and I know that she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks, I&rsquo;d rather not; I had one experience
with the old girl, and that was enough. Oh, I&rsquo;ll get on
capitally. And if I want anything more, I can easily
come to you. You won&rsquo;t mind, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you our address
in London, and you can write to me. I shall be up
there in a week&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wrote it down on the back of an envelope and
gave it to Brian. They shook hands again quite heartily,
and Brian, retaining Comethup&rsquo;s hand for a moment,
said, in his friendly fashion: &ldquo;Wish me luck. I&rsquo;m going
to set the Thames on fire, if ever a man set it flaring yet.
You know what that means, don&rsquo;t you? They say that
of any one who&rsquo;s going to do something more wonderful
than any one else. I know what&rsquo;s in me; I know what
I can do. And that wretched old sleepy hollow where you
and I once lived, Comethup&mdash;I&rsquo;ve done with the infernal
place. It shall be proud of me some day&mdash;proud to think
that I lived there, that I was born there; oh, I&rsquo;ll make
them whisper my name with awe, and condone all my
past offences. Good-bye, old chap; it&rsquo;s awfully good of
you, and some day, when I&rsquo;m rich and famous, I&rsquo;ll pay it
back&mdash;I will, indeed. Good-bye; I&rsquo;ll write and let you
know how I get on. But you&rsquo;ll hear of me&mdash;oh, you&rsquo;ll
hear of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He crammed the envelope and the notes into his
pocket and set off down the road, turning once to wave
his hand to Comethup, who stood at the gate watching
him.</p>

<p>The captain turned in briskly at the school gates on
the following morning immediately after breakfast. He
seemed to glow with the conscious pride of one intimately
associated with the most important man of the
day; to be proud of the fact that he was bearing off the
boy whom it was the school&rsquo;s delight to honour, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Comethup was the head boy of the school and captain of
the Eleven&mdash;a man whom little boys regarded with awe, as
he, when a little boy, had once regarded the captains who
had long since passed out of the school. Very proud,
too, was the captain to have this big lad slip his hand
under his own weaker arm and stroll with him about the
playground and among groups of admiring boys; prouder
still when the head master, whom the modest captain regarded
as a very wonder for learning, came to him and
shook hands and murmured a few appropriate words
about the loss the school would suffer with the departure
of Comethup Willis.</p>

<p>The day, with its cricket match&mdash;in which Comethup
covered himself, for the last time, with glory&mdash;came to
an end, and the captain and the boy were free to depart.
A fly was at the gate; Comethup&rsquo;s boxes were piled
upon it, and a crowd of younger boys had gathered about
to see him go and to give him a final cheer. In the
pride of the hour he had determined to drive the captain
the whole of the way home, in order to save the trouble
of the short train journey; the captain had expostulated,
but Comethup had laughingly had his way.</p>

<p>As the fly started, the eldest boy, who would be captain
next term in Comethup&rsquo;s place, cried lustily, &ldquo;Three
cheers for Willis!&rdquo; and Captain Garraway-Kyle stood
up in the vehicle, snatched off his hat and waved it,
and responded heartily. As he sat down again, and the
fly, turning the corner of the road, left the familiar faces
behind, he said in a gratified tone: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s music, boy;
that&rsquo;s the best of all music. When it comes from the
throats of those who love you, it&rsquo;s the finest orchestra in
the world; sometimes it comes falsely, and means nothing;
and then, if you have but the right ears to hear,
the music is all jangled horribly, and means nothing
but lies, and fawnings, and hypocrisy. But that&rsquo;s the
right music, boys&mdash;the music that comes from those who
love us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They drove on for some time in silence, and then the
captain said abruptly: &ldquo;I had a visitor this morning, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
a state of great excitement; he hasn&rsquo;t been near me since
you went to London. Can you guess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup looked at him inquiringly and shook his
head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your uncle, Robert Carlaw. Said he&rsquo;d had a great
shock; that Brian had left him suddenly, without giving
the slightest warning of where he was going or what his
intentions were; he had merely left a curt note&mdash;I saw
the note, and it was really very rude&mdash;a curt note saying
he was going away, and did not intend to return or to
trouble his father again. I suppose that mad fellow,
your uncle, was fond of the boy in his way; at all events,
he ramped and raved about the place, and talked of ingratitude,
and serpents&rsquo; teeth, and thankless children,
and what not, until I was quite glad to get rid of him. I
wonder where the boy has gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw him yesterday,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;He came
here&mdash;to the school, you know&mdash;to see me. He told me he
was going to London to make his fortune; that he&rsquo;d quarrelled
with his father, and didn&rsquo;t mean to go back to him.
I was awfully surprised to see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s he going to do in London, without
friends and without money?&rdquo; Then, as Comethup sat
silent, looking before him, the captain dropped a hand on
the boy&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Comethup, he didn&rsquo;t come to you merely
to say good-bye, after seeing nothing of you for eight
years. I suppose you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I could see that he was in distress,&rdquo; broke in
Comethup, hurriedly, &ldquo;and when I&rsquo;d got such a lot I
couldn&rsquo;t very well let him go to London without a penny.
You see, London is a big place, and he might starve&mdash;anything
might happen. So I just gave him&mdash;well, just a
little money; and I told him to write to me and let me
know how he was getting on; I gave him my address in
London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain was silent for a few moments, and then
he said: &ldquo;Well, well, I suppose you were right; you
couldn&rsquo;t let the fellow go without a penny. But if I
were you, Comethup, I shouldn&rsquo;t mention the matter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
your aunt. I detest deceit, but there are some things
it&rsquo;s just as well in this world to say nothing about. Miss
Carlaw&mdash;very properly, no doubt&mdash;dislikes your cousin,
and she might be hurt if she thought you were spending
her money on him. Personally, I don&rsquo;t like the fellow,
but I think it was the only thing you could do. But I
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d say anything to Miss Carlaw about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was quite a new sensation, and a very pleasant and
exciting one, to drive into the old town seated beside
the captain. The eight years, which had seemed to bring
so many changes to the growing boy, had not changed
the place at all; it appeared a little dwarfed, perhaps,
grown smaller and less imposing; the gaunt old buildings,
which had towered to the sky in the imagination of the
small child, had dwindled, in the eyes of the youth, to
mere ordinary dwellings. But, best of all, the things
about it that were changeless were the solemn hush and
peace that lay upon it, a stillness that belonged to no
other place. The roar of London, the busy, murmuring
life of school, were dropped completely behind; it was
like coming home to rest, to some little place set in the
heart of woods, after the toil and fret of a long day.</p>

<p>Homer was there, at the door of the captain&rsquo;s cottage,
saluting in the old fashion; he had grown a little grayer
and a little less erect in attitude. The old familiar room,
looking out over the garden and the street, seemed smaller
than before and a little shabbier. Of everything the boy
remembered so well, the captain alone seemed as though
the years had leaped over him and left him unaltered.</p>

<p>Comethup was up very early the next morning&mdash;long
before the captain had risen; he had a feeling that he
would like to visit some of the old places alone. He
lifted the latch of the cottage door&mdash;for no one thought
of locking doors in that part of the country&mdash;and stole
out softly through the garden and into the street. One
or two early risers whom he passed looked at him curiously,
and he thought he recognised some faces he had
seen in the streets as a child. He sniffed the sweet morning
air with delight, thinking how good it was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
rich and free and healthy; he might have thought, too,
how good it was to be very young, but for the fact that he
did not consciously appreciate that blessing.</p>

<p>He went to the house in which he had been born; it
was held by strangers now, and there were curtains of a
hideous colour in the windows, and one of the blinds had
been drawn up by a careless hand and hung awry. But
the roses were there in all their beauty&mdash;roses grown for
other hands to pluck and to delight other eyes. He
leaned over the little gate which led from the street and
looked about him; looked into all the familiar corners
that had held such terrors for him when he had been
very young indeed; thought of the mother who had wandered
there, as he had heard his father describe. And
that brought him quite naturally to the churchyard,
where he found the two mounds&mdash;a little less prominent
than they had been&mdash;side by side, with some fresh flowers
upon them. He knew that the flowers must have come
from the captain, and his heart swelled a little, with renewed
gratitude to his old friend.</p>

<p>It was too early for breakfast yet, and he set off
through the town; aimlessly, as he told himself, and yet
of fixed purpose. There seemed to be but one place that
he desired to visit, and his pulses thumped a little, in
an unaccustomed fashion, as he drew near to it; it was
the garden in which he had found &rsquo;Linda.</p>

<p>The years had brought one change on the very
threshold of it: one of the gates&mdash;that which had hung
by a single hinge so long&mdash;had given way completely, and
lay prone upon the grass inside, half covered with dead
leaves and choking weeds. Comethup picked his way
across it and walked cautiously under the trees. Bright
as the morning was, it seemed quite dark here, and he
shivered a little as he went on. He almost expected to
see a little figure he remembered so clearly spring up
again in his path and run to him, crying his name; but
no one was in the garden, and only a bird fluttered among
the leaves and cried in quick alarm to his mate. He
made the circuit of the house, and looked up at the blank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
windows; but the place seemed quite deserted, and he
came away, wondering a little impatiently where the girl
could be, and filled with a determination to invoke the
aid of the captain in order that he might see her.</p>

<p>A glance at his watch told him that the captain&rsquo;s
breakfast hour was near at hand, and he hurried back to
the cottage. As he drew near to it he saw that some one
was in the garden&mdash;a young girl, tall and slim, in a sober
gray gown, with little ruffles at the throat and wrists.
Her back was turned toward him, and she was busily
gathering the choicest of the captain&rsquo;s roses. Even then
no suspicion of her identity entered his mind; he stopped
for a moment, wondering, and then walked to the gate
and pushed it open.</p>

<p>The click of the iron latch caught her ear, and she
turned swiftly, with the roses held close against her
breast. Comethup caught his breath as he looked at her.
Something strangely familiar, and yet strangely unfamiliar,
was in her attitude, and in the glance she gave
him; he was still tugging at his memory and hesitating
on that half recognition of her, when she came forward
slowly, smiling and colouring a little. And then he
knew her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Linda!&rdquo; he faltered, and pulled his cap off awkwardly.</p>

<p>She thrust the bundle of roses into the curve of one
arm and shyly held out her hand to him, yet with a self-possession
that only increased his nervousness. He took
the hand and held it, and did not quite know what to do
with it, until she released it, and laughed, and looked at
her roses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The captain told me you were coming, Comethup,&rdquo;
she said. And then, quite irrelevantly, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a beautiful
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lovely,&rdquo; murmured Comethup absently, looking at
her rather than at the sky. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been looking for
you at&mdash;at the old house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you? I got up quite early this morning; we
must have missed each other. You see, the captain likes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
roses, and I thought that these would look nice&mdash;in a
bowl, you know&mdash;on the breakfast table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they will,&rdquo; said Comethup, getting his
voice a little under control and wondering vaguely why
his throat was so dry. &ldquo;Do you know, I didn&rsquo;t know you
at first, &rsquo;Linda; I&rsquo;d quite forgotten that you&rsquo;d be&mdash;be
grown up. It&rsquo;s such a long time, you see; everything
seems to have altered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. <i>You</i>&rsquo;ve altered, Comethup, very much.&rdquo; She
plucked another rose and added it to the bunch, and
pressed her face down upon them. Without looking up,
she said, &ldquo;Shall we go in and put them in water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think we&rsquo;d better.&rdquo; He was so much in awe
of her that he was quite afraid to come near her, and
kept his distance, accordingly, in the narrow path. He
opened the door for her, and, in her nervousness, she
caught her foot on the step and tumbled against him;
they both blushed and laughed, and she dropped some of
the roses. Comethup stooped to pick them up, and found
that they were not at all easy things to get hold of; they
seemed to slip out of his fingers as easily as they had
slipped out of hers. However, they were all picked up at
last, and the two went together into the captain&rsquo;s little
sitting room.</p>

<p>There a bowl had to be found, and Comethup was
quite glad to get away for a moment to fetch water, in
order that he might recover his feelings. She was very
busy with the flowers when he came back, setting them
in place in the big bowl, and singing softly to herself as
she did so. Once, when a flower fell over the edge,
Comethup sprang to reach it, and their hands met on
the table; the hand and arm seemed to burn, and he wondered,
desperately and foolishly, if his face had turned
red, and why it was so impossible to talk naturally and
easily to her&mdash;why, indeed, he could find nothing to talk
about.</p>

<p>The entrance of the captain seemed to put them
both at their ease. He came a little way into the room
and stood there, with his hands behind him, looking with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
a pleased smile at Comethup and at the face of the girl
glancing up at him from the flowers. She nodded brightly
to him and ran across and took him by the lapels of
his coat and kissed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you stole a march on me, eh?&rdquo; said the captain,
glancing from one to the other. &ldquo;While the old boy is
asleep you two youngsters have been getting the benefit
of the morning air, eh? Well, you look as bright and
fresh as the morning, both of you.&mdash;What do you think of
her, Comethup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup laughed and blushed, shifted from one foot
to the other, and weakly hazarded the opinion that she
had grown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grown!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain. &ldquo;I should think
so. Time stands still with the old ones, but, Lord! what
a change a year or two makes! Why, I remember the
time when I had to stoop and bend my old back for her
to stand on tiptoe to kiss me; and now&mdash;well, look at her,
boy; I can keep as straight as a lance, and still the rogue&rsquo;s
lips can reach me. So you didn&rsquo;t lose time about finding
your old playmate, Comethup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Comethup, &ldquo;I found her in the garden
here, only a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; broke in &rsquo;Linda, &ldquo;but he says that he&rsquo;d been
to look for me, and couldn&rsquo;t find me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet found you after all, eh? Trust him for
that. Now let&rsquo;s have some breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;Linda, after a little protest, took off her hat and
sat down with them. She kept very near to the captain,
and seldom looked at Comethup, save now and then shyly,
after he had found his tongue, and was relating in boyish
fashion some of his school adventures. The captain
threw in interjectional remarks for &rsquo;Linda&rsquo;s benefit, such
as &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a boy for you!&rdquo; or &ldquo;What do you think of
that now?&rdquo; and others to the like effect. After breakfast,
the girl, in seeming haste, put on her hat and hurriedly
kissed the captain, shyly touched Comethup&rsquo;s hand,
and prepared to depart. Comethup found his courage
then and said blushingly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m only stopping with the captain for a
week, &rsquo;Linda. I suppose&mdash;I hope I shall see you&mdash;very
often?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain broke in heartily before she had time to
reply. &ldquo;Why, of course; you must come to breakfast
every morning, and then we can plan some excursion for
the day and make the most of our time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; urged Comethup eagerly. &ldquo;We might go for a
drive sometimes, you know. It would be rather jolly, sir&rdquo;&mdash;he
turned to the captain appealingly&mdash;&ldquo;it would be
jolly if we could go for a picnic one day, and take our
lunch with us, wouldn&rsquo;t it? You see, &rsquo;Linda, we could go
wherever you liked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be splendid!&rdquo; said the girl, clasping her
hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been for a drive in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go to-morrow,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;We
can start directly after breakfast and make a day of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain and Comethup spent that first day in
strolling about the neighbourhood and sitting out on the
sandy hillocks beyond the town, talking&mdash;mostly of the
future&mdash;and dreaming old dreams over again of the past.
There seemed so much to be said in that familiar atmosphere;
it seemed so easy to live over again the old days,
when Comethup had known no other existence.</p>

<p>On the day arranged for the picnic &rsquo;Linda came running
into the garden just as breakfast was placed on the
table; breathlessly kissed the captain, and shook hands
with Comethup; announced, with a roguish shake of her
head, that she would not take off her hat, as they were
to start so soon; and chattered ceaselessly and happily
about everything&mdash;the weather, the horses that were to
take them, the road by which they should go, and a thousand
other things. Comethup had ordered a capacious
carriage from the inn the night before&mdash;an open carriage
to hold four, with two horses. Homer&mdash;most wonderful
of men&mdash;had prepared a huge luncheon basket, to the contents
of which Comethup had added a couple of bottles
of claret. The carriage drew up at the gate just as they
had finished breakfast, and &rsquo;Linda ran out to inspect it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Comethup followed her, and stood beside her at the
gate, waiting for the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; he said,
slowly, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s a fine day, and&mdash;and that you&rsquo;re so
pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned round swiftly, her dark eyes dancing.
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the first real holiday I&rsquo;ve ever had; I couldn&rsquo;t
sleep last night for thinking about it. But&rdquo;&mdash;her brows
wrinkled a little anxiously&mdash;&ldquo;won&rsquo;t this cost&mdash;cost a lot
of money?&rdquo; She waved her hand toward the carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not much,&rdquo; said Comethup carelessly. &ldquo;Besides,
it doesn&rsquo;t matter; we&rsquo;ll have a jolly day, and you
know I&rsquo;ve got plenty of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He heard a sigh flutter from her lips, and had a boyish
longing to tell her that he should like to share every
penny he had, or every penny he ever would have, with
her; that she might never have any fear that he would
go away and leave her without a holiday. He was almost
making up his mind to say that he would give her just
such a holiday as this every day of his life, irrespective of
weather, when the captain came down the path and
joined them, followed by Homer staggering under the
weight of the luncheon basket.</p>

<p>The captain had a new tie for the occasion, and was
dressed in his best; he gallantly handed &rsquo;Linda in, and
she and Comethup took their places at the back of the
carriage, the captain facing them. The captain was in
high feather; heard the regular beat of the horses&rsquo; hoofs
behind him, and held himself more erect in consequence.
Comethup and &rsquo;Linda sat silent, except when they answered
the captain&rsquo;s remarks, or when &rsquo;Linda said something
about the beauty of the day, or of the scenery, on
which occasions Comethup eagerly and cordially indorsed
her opinion.</p>

<p>They were to drive to a little wood the beauty of
which was celebrated in the neighbourhood, although
neither the captain nor his companions had ever penetrated
so far. It was some fifteen miles distant, near a
little old-world village, and they leaned back contentedly
in their seats with the prospect of a long and pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
drive before them. Suddenly, from the side of the road,
they heard a hail, and the horses were drawn up sharply.
Comethup turned about, and saw a figure hurrying toward
them&mdash;the figure of a man, with long coat-tails
flapping in the wind and a hand waving to them. The
captain frowned a little, and muttered something under
his breath. The figure came rapidly nearer, and disclosed
itself as that of Mr. Robert Carlaw, heated and
flushed; a little more full of habit, Comethup thought,
than in former days, and a little more red in the face,
but the same smiling, swaggering Robert Carlaw as of old.</p>

<p>He stopped at the carriage door, and pulled off his hat
with a flourish to &rsquo;Linda; saw Comethup, and fell back
a step, in delighted amazement. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is
it possible that I look again upon the little nephew of
whom I have thought so often? And yet, little no
longer. Alas! time works changes upon us all. My boy&rdquo;&mdash;he
spoke with some emotion&mdash;&ldquo;give me your hand.
Little Comethup! And so you&rsquo;ve come back to your old
haunts, you lucky man of fortune, to turn the heads of
all the pretty girls, eh?&rdquo; He glanced at &rsquo;Linda, and
smiled and shook his head. &ldquo;Gad! you make me wish
my youth could come back to me, although I never had
<i>your</i> chances. With good looks, and fortune, and youth&mdash;well,
the ball&rsquo;s at your feet now; you&rsquo;re a lucky rascal.
And so we drive our carriage, do we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup had shaken hands with him somewhat diffidently.
&ldquo;I am very glad to see you, uncle,&rdquo; he said,
as soon as Mr. Carlaw had finished speaking. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
just off for a picnic; I&rsquo;m staying with the captain for a
week, before I go on to London. I&rsquo;ve just left school,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A picnic! Oh, for the days of picnics, and pretty
faces, and murmuring brooks, and the deuce knows what
else! Gone, alas! forever. But what do I see? A
vacant seat. Youth and beauty on one side, and crabbed
age on the other. Gad! I&rsquo;ll balance you; youth and beauty
run in couples, captain&mdash;crabbed age shall pair as well.
I&rsquo;ll join you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>He had the carriage door open and a foot on the
step before any one could speak. But the captain put
out a hand. &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can assure you
that we did not contemplate an addition&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Robert Carlaw cut him short. &ldquo;Not a word,
not a word,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Picnics are like all other
joyous things in the world&mdash;the more the merrier. And
I&rsquo;m not a great eater, by any means.&rdquo; He was into the
carriage by this time, and had dropped with a sigh of
contentment beside the captain, thrusting that little gentleman
ruthlessly out of the way. He closed the door,
and the carriage moved on again.</p>

<p>He had taken the matter so completely by storm, and
it was so impossible to tell him that he wasn&rsquo;t wanted,
and to stop the carriage and thrust him out again, that
the three holiday-makers resigned themselves to the inevitable
and sat in awkward silence, casting furtive
glances at him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="subheading">AN INCUBUS, AND THE DEMON OF JEALOUSY.</p>


<p>Of all the people in their small world, it is possible
that Mr. Robert Carlaw was quite the last they would
have chosen as a companion for what had promised to
be a happy day. He sat for some time in gloomy thought,
waking now and then to a sudden smile, as though joyousness
were expected of him, but showing plainly that
the effort cost him something, and was difficult. The
lightness had gone out of the others, too; they sat more
stiffly than they had done, and looked anywhere but at
him. At last, with a sigh, he broke the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not tell you,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;how grateful I am to
Providence that I met you. For me the sun shines no
more; blackness creeps about me. If I should laugh a
little in the sun to-day, if I should be glad that bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
faces are before me&rdquo;&mdash;he bowed toward the young people&mdash;&ldquo;believe
that it is only a passing thing, and that despair&mdash;horrible
despair&mdash;will claim me for its own within
a few hours. Sir&rdquo;&mdash;he turned abruptly on the captain&mdash;&ldquo;I
am a most unhappy man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I am sorry to hear it,&rdquo; replied the captain
coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A most unhappy man,&rdquo; pursued the other. &ldquo;I have
been stung, sir, stung to the quick; I have nursed&mdash;nay,
fondled&mdash;a viper in my bosom, with the inevitable result.
I allude, sir, to my son. Debts I could have forgiven,
recklessness I could condone&mdash;it is in the blood, and
must out; but ingratitude, never! When I think of all
that that boy owes to me&mdash;his talents, his education,
everything&mdash;I feel that it is too much. Even the family
temper&mdash;the temper that will take him far&mdash;he owes to
me. And now, sir, what does he do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain shifted uneasily in his seat, and Comethup
looked distressed; &rsquo;Linda had turned her head away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He forsakes me in my declining years; mocks the
hand that fed him; leaves me to loneliness and despair.
And yet, foolish creature that I am, my heart still yearns
for him; my hearth is still warm for him. After all,&rdquo; he
pursued, in a lighter vein, &ldquo;I suppose I have no right to
complain. As I have said, it is in the blood; he bears the
taint that has kept his wretched father down in the
world, and yet&mdash;thank God!&mdash;the taint which has kept
him a gentleman.&rdquo; His breast swelled, and he shook his
head valiantly.</p>

<p>No one quite knew what to say, and there was an awkward
silence. Comethup glanced at &rsquo;Linda, but she was
still looking out across the country, and he could not
clearly see her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; went on Mr. Robert Carlaw, rapidly regaining
his more joyous manner&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose that one
must expect that young birds will try their wings, and
fly from the nest in time. I trust that he will fly strongly;
I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> he will fly strongly. But he was made for
better things than to seek his fortune in the rough-and-tumble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of the world. Like his unfortunate father, he is
a disappointed man; he should have had a fortune, but
for the caprices&mdash;there, there, we will say no more of
that. I had hoped, too, that he might have remained,
for another reason; I had almost believed that a childish
attachment was ripening into&mdash;but no matter; time will
show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup glanced at &rsquo;Linda again; her face was still
averted, but on her cheek he could see that a sudden
flush had grown, and that her hands were toying nervously
with a ribbon at her waist. Deep down in his heart
a little sudden chill of uneasiness sprang up and clouded
the day for him; he had a quick memory of the last time
he had traversed that road in a carriage as a child, when
he had seen his cousin and the girl strolling down a lane
together, the boy&rsquo;s arm round her neck. He wanted to
spring up and tell Mr. Robert Carlaw that it wasn&rsquo;t
true, that no one wanted him there, and that he was spoiling
everything and making every one unhappy. But he
sat still, and for a time they drove on in silence.</p>

<p>The picnic was not a success. The day was perfect,
Homer&rsquo;s catering of the best, and the wine excellent;
but, hovering over all, was the melancholy spirit of Mr.
Robert Carlaw, accompanied, strangely enough, in Comethup&rsquo;s
mind at least, by another spirit&mdash;that of a bright-faced,
handsome fellow, wandering alone in a big city
and fighting hard against desperate odds. Certainly Mr.
Carlaw did his best to be agreeable; showed much alacrity
in opening bottles and spreading out the contents of the
basket; was eager in his attentions to Comethup, whom
he persistently styled &ldquo;my lucky nephew.&rdquo; Indeed, it
became evident that he was anxious to ingratiate himself
in Comethup&rsquo;s good graces; he pressed wine upon him, as
though the feast had been of his giving; sat beside him
and flattered him with talk of the boy&rsquo;s school career&mdash;of
which he professed to have heard minute details; and
generally endeavoured to be very lively and agreeable.</p>

<p>After the meal was ended, and they had all regained
something of their lost spirits, &rsquo;Linda laughingly announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
that she was going to search for fairies in the
wood, and ran off among the trees; Comethup sprang up
and went after her. But even here Robert Carlaw was
not to be shaken off; he cried out something about his
youth returning, and plunged after them. The fairies
were forgotten, and Comethup strolled sulkily beside her,
with Mr. Robert Carlaw close at his elbow, swinging his
stick jauntily and humming an air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A word with you, my dear nephew,&rdquo; he said, linking
his arm in that of the boy and bending his head toward
him. &ldquo;Our young friend here does not matter, and is
probably&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled and nodded at her&mdash;&ldquo;sympathetic.
I have always had a kindly feeling for you, my dear boy.
In the case of another man, who carried his heart less
openly on his sleeve than I do, that feeling might have
been lessened by the fact that an inscrutable Providence
thrust you into my boy&rsquo;s place. But that, sir, does not influence
me; my heart rings true to those of my own blood,
those I would call my friends, without any consideration
of mere earthly gain to influence me. In a word, boy&rdquo;&mdash;this
with charming frankness&mdash;&ldquo;I like you; fortune has
not spoiled you, and I feel that there is much in our
natures&mdash;simplicity and guilelessness&mdash;that is akin. I
want you to look upon me as your friend; I do not want
us to lose sight of each other. The world is a wicked
place, full, I am told, of schemers and double dealers.
You may need protection; count on me. Remember that
my poor house, such as it is, is open to you. I may be
coming to London&mdash;probably in search of my truant&mdash;and
we may meet. There are those in London who know
Bob Carlaw&mdash;good fellows all, mind you, and gentlemen&mdash;and
I promise you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have a dull moment. Oh, I
assure you Bob is well known in town&mdash;among the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup, who was really a little captivated by the
man&rsquo;s manner, murmured politely that he would be very
glad to see him in town, and that he was quite sure they
would always be good friends. Mr. Robert Carlaw wrung
his hand and clapped him on the shoulder, and appeared
very grateful and very much moved. So complete was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
gratitude, indeed, that he was not to be shaken off in any
way; he kept quite close to his young friend until they
were all ready to get again into the carriage.</p>

<p>The drive home was a silent one, at least for some
part of it. Within a few miles of the town Mr. Robert
Carlaw fell into a heavy slumber, and the three drew
heads together and conversed in whispers. Comethup,
who had not been very happy all day, received unexpected
comfort, for, as he sat beside the girl, he suddenly
felt her warm, slim fingers slipped into his hand, and he
held them softly until the carriage stopped. If the captain
saw anything, he was discreet enough not to appear
to notice it.</p>

<p>They shook Mr. Carlaw to consciousness at his own
gate. He was profuse in apologies and thanks, and it was
somewhat difficult to get rid of him; indeed, he ran back
to the carriage just as it was starting, to grasp Comethup
again by the hand and to look fervently into his eyes.</p>

<p>They all got out at the captain&rsquo;s cottage, and &rsquo;Linda
and Comethup lingered for a moment in the garden
among the roses, while the captain went inside. When
the captain came out again, smoking, the girl announced
that she must go home at once; it was getting late. Comethup
immediately offered to escort her, and she kissed the
captain and went off with the boy down the road in the
twilight.</p>

<p>Now there were a hundred things which Comethup
wished to say; a hundred indefinite and tantalizing matters
to which he seemed vaguely to seek an answer. But
the boy was more afraid of this slip of a girl than he had
ever been of anything or any one in all his life; the very
flutter of her dress in the semi-darkness, the light touch
of a ribbon-end which blew out and whipped his hand
once as he walked beside her, were disquieting and awe-inspiring
things. He tried frantically, as he had tried
before, to hark back to the old days when they had been
children, and she had clung to him and cried upon his
shoulder. But this was no child; this was something
wonderful, that had her eyes and her voice, and a suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of her in many little ways; but it was a different
being, and the child of old times might have been a ghost
indeed, as he had once believed, for anything she had in
common with this girl. Yet something must be said, and
he plunged at the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Linda!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked round at him quickly. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so awfully glad that&mdash;that you&rsquo;ve been able to
go with us there. I mean that I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s been glorious! I can feel the swing of the
carriage now, even while I&rsquo;m walking. And it&rsquo;s been
such a lovely day! Of course, it would have been better
if Mr. Carlaw hadn&rsquo;t dropped down upon us; but it was
very nice as it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t have been half so nice if&mdash;if you
hadn&rsquo;t been there,&rdquo; ventured Comethup, trembling. &ldquo;I
mean that I&mdash;oh, I haven&rsquo;t had a chance of saying how
glad I was to find that you&mdash;that you remembered me,
and&mdash;and liked me; you know I had all the messages you
sent me while I was at school; I haven&rsquo;t forgotten one of
them; I couldn&rsquo;t forget them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; the captain always asked me if I had any
message for you, and so&mdash;and so of course I sent them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t mind sending them; I mean
you liked sending them,&rdquo; said Comethup, hurriedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course; we had been such good friends,
and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Comethup, eagerly. &ldquo;We were
always good friends, weren&rsquo;t we?&mdash;and although I&rsquo;ve been
away so long, still that doesn&rsquo;t make any difference, does
it? What I wanted to say was that&mdash;that I hope you
won&rsquo;t forget me when I&rsquo;ve gone to London; that I shall
be able to see you sometimes. You won&rsquo;t forget me, will
you, &rsquo;Linda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had reached the gate leading into her father&rsquo;s
garden, and they passed in together. She looked round
at him for a moment and smiled, and held out her hand
quite frankly, with much of the girlish bashfulness gone.
&ldquo;No, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forget you, Comethup,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forget that you were my first friend. Do you
remember the night, long ago, when you found me here
in this garden? And then afterward you brought the
captain to me. How could I forget?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the hand, and held it in both his own. &ldquo;I
was quite sure you wouldn&rsquo;t, &rsquo;Linda,&rdquo; he said, gladly.
&ldquo;I never forgot you all the years I was at school, although
I couldn&rsquo;t see you. But I&rsquo;ll see you often now; I
shall be coming down from London to see the captain, I
expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;London?&rdquo; she said, absently. &ldquo;Every one seems to
go to London. Brian has gone there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came again that little chill feeling at his heart
to curb his gladness. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;I suppose
you&rsquo;ve seen a great deal of Brian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there was no one else to see, except the captain.
Brian and I have always been good friends; I think he
was quite sorry to go away from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup stirred the leaves impatiently with his
foot. &ldquo;I suppose&mdash;I suppose you&rsquo;re very&mdash;very fond of
Brian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed gayly, and twisted herself so that her
skirt twirled about her. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we got on
very well together. He was always getting into trouble,
poor boy, and then he used to come to me for advice.
You see, I&rsquo;d known him always; we met each other every
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup found himself making a rough calculation
of what eight times three hundred and sixty-five would
be, but checked himself in the midst of it to ask, &ldquo;I
suppose&mdash;you&rsquo;re ever so much fonder of him than you are
of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed again, and took a step or two toward the
house, then came back to him. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; she
said, softly. &ldquo;Besides, what does it matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;Only I should like
you&mdash;I should like you to be fond of me; I should
like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> fond of you, Comethup,&rdquo; she said; and laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
again, in that provoking fashion she had. He laughed
too, then, and held out his hand sheepishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, &rsquo;Linda,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She slipped her fingers round his, and drew nearer to
him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross,&rdquo; she said, in a whisper. &ldquo;I love
all my friends. You may kiss me if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned one cheek toward him, and he bent forward
reverently and touched it with his lips. Then,
waving her hand to him, she sped away between the trees
toward the house. He stood for some moments looking
after her, and then turned and walked back to the captain&rsquo;s
cottage, with his head in a whirl. He was quite
certain of two things: that &rsquo;Linda was the most beautiful
woman in the world, and that he was desperately in love
with her and would be prepared to face all things for her
sake, and perform prodigies of valour for her, and go
out, if need be, a lonely exile, carrying a broken heart in
his bosom and a stern yet gentle face to his fellows&mdash;all
of which he knew was the proper thing to do, from
the manly standpoint, in the present state of his feelings.</p>

<p>He saw &rsquo;Linda almost every day during his stay in the
old town; they walked and drove with the captain, and
came, toward the end of the week, to renew something of
the old happy familiarity of their childhood. Comethup
suffered all the tortures and all the ecstasies of a boy in
his condition; was set walking upon air by a word from
her, or a pressure of her fingers; or was plunged into the
depths of misery by a rebuff, however slight or meaningless.
But, being young and wonderfully healthy, he slept
well and did not lose his appetite; and the matter, serious
as he thought it, had no great effect upon him.</p>

<p>The day came when he was to start for London to join
his aunt. He had decided to drive to Deal, as she had
done, and there take a train for London; the fly was to
come for him and his belongings immediately after breakfast.
&rsquo;Linda breakfasted with them that morning, and
seemed, Comethup thought miserably, brighter and happier
than usual. For himself, he wondered what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
should say to her, or what she would have to say to him,
when the moment for parting came.</p>

<p>When the fly drew up at the door, he shook hands
with the captain and then turned toward the girl. With
downcast eyes she offered him her cheek and gave him
her hand; but the captain cried: &ldquo;Lips, you rogue; the
boy&rsquo;s not kissing his grandmother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blushingly she turned her face, and their lips met;
and Comethup stumbled somehow out of the house. As
he was getting into the fly she ran out of the garden and
came close to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comethup!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>He turned, and leaned toward her. &ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;Linda;
what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to London; you may meet&mdash;may see
Brian; oh, please carry my&mdash;my good wishes to him, and
say I want to know what he is doing and if he is prospering.
You will, won&rsquo;t you, Comethup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her eager face and nodded slowly and
solemnly. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him. We shall be
sure to meet, you know; I&rsquo;ll certainly tell him. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled gratefully, and kissed her hand to him. He
carried the remembrance of those last words of hers on
the journey to London, and turned them over and over as
he went.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="subheading">COMETHUP PRACTISES DECEPTION.</p>


<p>Miss Charlotte Carlaw was awaiting the arrival of
her nephew in the drawing room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have driven down,
my dear boy, but I find I don&rsquo;t get any lighter as time
goes on, and I thought you could possess your soul in
patience until you saw me. Come here, giant. Lord!
what a long time it seems since you first came into this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
house, a scrap of humanity I had to stoop to! And now
you&rsquo;re so big as to make me feel uncomfortable; and your
voice is deeper, and you&rsquo;ve finished your school days.
There, come and kiss a foolish old woman; I&rsquo;m devilish
proud of you, and I hear nothing but good reports of you.
I&rsquo;ve never said so before, but I say it now; it was the
best day&rsquo;s work I ever did when I found you and brought
you to London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good day for me, aunt,&rdquo; said Comethup, gratefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as it may be. I knew you&rsquo;d got the right
stuff in you, although if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the captain
I should probably have ruined you. And how is the captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup assured her that the captain was well, and
wished to be held in remembrance by the best woman in
the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what he says of me, is it?&rdquo; said Miss Charlotte
Carlaw, laughing, and rocking herself over the
head of her stick &ldquo;You might have told him I was
the happiest woman, if that&rsquo;s got anything to do with
it. Well, did you meet any one else down in Sleepy Hollow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Comethup slowly, as if labouring under
deep thought, &ldquo;I met my old playfellow, &rsquo;Linda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho! And what&rsquo;s our old playfellow like by this
time? Grown old and ugly&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Comethup, with a short laugh. &ldquo;I
think&mdash;the captain thinks&mdash;she&rsquo;s rather pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the captain thinks so, does he? And what does
Prince Charming think? There, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid to
tell me anything; you wouldn&rsquo;t be a boy, and you
wouldn&rsquo;t be your mother&rsquo;s son, if you didn&rsquo;t fall over head
and ears in love with some one. And I suppose you&rsquo;ve
said all sorts of pretty things to each other, and she&rsquo;s
given you a ribbon or a flower, or something or other, and
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t given me
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re both of you devilish backward for your
ages, that&rsquo;s all I can say. Did you kiss her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said Comethup slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s better. Well, I won&rsquo;t ask any more questions;
I suppose it isn&rsquo;t fair. Now sit down and tell me
all about the end of your school days&mdash;all you haven&rsquo;t told
in your letters&mdash;beautiful letters they were, too, Prince
Charming, and I had only one grievance about them: that
some one else should have to read them to me. However,
that can&rsquo;t be helped. Now tell me what they said
to you when you left, and whether they were sorry, and
whether they cheered you, or if there were any speeches.
Oh, I had a mind to come down and walk with my dear
boy among the people who looked up to him and loved
him; I&rsquo;ve been mighty jealous of you, and mighty proud.
Eight years ago, or more, I struck a bargain with you,
and you&rsquo;ve held to it more faithfully than many a man
could have done. I wasn&rsquo;t mistaken in you, Comethup,
and some day perhaps you&rsquo;ll know how you&rsquo;ve changed
my life and what you&rsquo;ve really done for me. Now tell
me everything. Lunch will be ready directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup entered into a long recital of his doings,
sharply questioned at intervals by Miss Carlaw as to the
number of runs he had made here and the number of
wickets he had taken there; she appeared to know all the
technicalities of everything that had concerned him by
heart. The recital lasted well into the middle of lunch,
and she heard it through to the bitter end with complete
and smiling satisfaction. Then, after sitting silent for
some minutes, she turned abruptly to him, and felt for
his hand upon the table and covered it with her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear boy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been away
from me, for the most part, for eight years. I am a
lonely old woman and one who has but one love in her
life, and that&rsquo;s you. I&rsquo;ve missed you and longed for you
dreadfully; but I knew it was all for the best, and you
were growing to be a brave and clever lad, and so I put
up with it. Now, it&rsquo;s no good blinking facts; I&rsquo;m getting
old, and, at the best, I haven&rsquo;t got so many years of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
before me. I&rsquo;ve thought of all sorts of things for you&mdash;professions
into which I might put you; I&rsquo;ve thought of
sending you to one of the universities. But these years
have taught me a lesson. I can&rsquo;t spare you. After all,
there are plenty of poor devils in this world who have
got to earn their living, and I don&rsquo;t see why you, who
have plenty, should stand in the way of any one of
them. I know you&rsquo;d beat &rsquo;em hollow, whatever you took
up, if you once started; but I&rsquo;m not going to let you try.
As I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;m a lonely old woman, and I&rsquo;m devilish
tired of my own company. If you can put up with me,
and are not ashamed of me&mdash;no, no, boy, I ought not to
have said that; forgive me&mdash;I think we might manage,
for a year or two, to run about the world together and
have a good time. I&rsquo;ve never travelled yet, for travel
simply means inconvenience; but you shall be my eyes,
and we&rsquo;ll educate you in our own fashion. You shall see
all that this good old earth has to show you, and you
shall tell me all about it and give me your own impressions;
and I shall be happy, and we&rsquo;ll both be happy. I
don&rsquo;t want to make a vagabond of you; but there&rsquo;s a
good idleness as well as a bad idleness, and we&rsquo;ll see if
we can&rsquo;t find the first. What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be splendid,&rdquo; said Comethup.
&ldquo;There are lots of places I&rsquo;ve heard of that I should
like to see, and if you think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think about it; I&rsquo;ve made up my mind.
There are people who&rsquo;ll say that a blind old creature,
such as I am, ought not to hang like a millstone round a
boy&rsquo;s neck; but I think we shall manage to rub along together&mdash;eh,
Comethup? At the same time&rdquo;&mdash;she held
up a warning forefinger&mdash;&ldquo;if you feel any doubts about
the matter, or have any other purpose in your mind, out
with it. Let&rsquo;s have plain sailing to begin with, and we
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t make blunders afterward. I don&rsquo;t want you to be
reckless; but you shall have plenty of money, and we
can afford to travel in the best style and to go to the best
places. I shall trust to you so completely that I intend
to put the management of everything in your hands; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
shall draw upon me for what you want, and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ask
you questions. Now what&rsquo;s it to be, Yes or No?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, with all my heart,&rdquo; replied Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good; we&rsquo;ll call it settled. I purpose starting
almost immediately, and we shall probably be away for
three or four years; but that will depend upon how things
turn out. Now let&rsquo;s talk about something else. Did
you meet any one else when you were staying with the
captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we met Uncle Bob one day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Robert Carlaw? What did <i>he</i> want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he wanted anything,&rdquo; replied Comethup.
&ldquo;He came to a picnic with us&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t invite him,
but he came&mdash;and was very nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Bob wouldn&rsquo;t want any inviting. It&rsquo;s my honest
belief that that man will manage to get into heaven one
day by sheer bounce; I don&rsquo;t see how they&rsquo;re to keep
him out. So he was very nice, was he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very. He suggested he might be coming to
London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Carlaw nodded her head a great many times.
&ldquo;Oh, I dare say. Well, I&rsquo;m not going to coerce you, or
to control your actions in any way, but I wish you to
have nothing to do with that man, or with his son. It
may be prejudice, and I dare say it&rsquo;s very wrong; but I
don&rsquo;t like him, and I never shall, and they won&rsquo;t do you
any good. What&rsquo;s the boy doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s in London,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;I know
he came to London to make his fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make his fiddlesticks! That boy&rsquo;ll never make his
fortune unless he makes it out of somebody else. I don&rsquo;t
want to be uncharitable, Comethup, but he&rsquo;s like his
father, and his father shuffles. If you take my advice
you&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with either of them. I dare say
people would accuse me of injustice, and would say that
I ought to have put that boy in the place you occupy.
But, in the first place, he&rsquo;s had a father to look after him,
and you hadn&rsquo;t; and, in the second place, I&rsquo;m devilish
glad I wasn&rsquo;t such a fool. No, Comethup, I&rsquo;m quite satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
with my bargain, and you and I will make the best
of life together and have a good time. I look upon you
as a man now, although you&rsquo;re young, and shall expect
you to behave as a man. Now, I suppose you&rsquo;ve spent
all your money&mdash;there, I don&rsquo;t want to hear details&mdash;and
want some more? You&rsquo;ve left your school days behind
now, and I suppose we must treat you differently. Come
with me, and we&rsquo;ll see if we can find a cheque for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He conducted his aunt to a little room where she
wrote her letters and transacted her business generally.
He had often seen her write, and had been astonished at
the ease and accuracy with which she did it&mdash;writing on
a curious board, with slips of metal, having notches in
them, stretched across it; with the aid of this she carried
on quite a large correspondence in a clear, neat hand.
So used had she become to it that she quite easily fitted
in a cheque, seeming to take rapid measurements on it
with her fingers, filled it up, signed it, and handed it
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s for fifty pounds. As I&rsquo;ve
told you, I don&rsquo;t want you to be reckless, but you can
have more when you want it. You know where the bank
is, and you can drive there whenever you like and cash it.
There&rsquo;s only one thing I want you clearly to understand:
I want you to be a man and to learn your way about;
and I want you to keep a clear and open face to the world
and to me. Do that always, and we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t quarrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He commenced a halting form of thanks, but she
checked him and waved him away, explaining that she
had business to attend to, and smilingly adding that
she couldn&rsquo;t be bothered with him. But the business
proved to be of short duration. The proud old woman
soon came bustling up to the boy&rsquo;s sitting room in search
of him, and suggested a drive. The carriage was ordered,
and they selected as their route, at Miss Carlaw&rsquo;s command,
the most public and fashionable ways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be away from London for a long time,&rdquo; said
Miss Carlaw soon after they had started, &ldquo;and London
won&rsquo;t have a chance of seeing my boy. So we&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
a chance now; we&rsquo;ll let &rsquo;em see that the Prince Charming
they knew has grown a man indeed. Do they look at you?
Do they stare? Lord! it&rsquo;s at this time I want my eyes
most; I never felt the want of &rsquo;em until you came. But
I mustn&rsquo;t grumble; I shall have a judgment on me if I
grumble after all my blessings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jealousy and envy racked her foolish old heart as
much as they had ever done. Amid all her joy at his return,
she fell very often into a despondent mood; strove,
in a strange, pitiful fashion that was almost grotesque,
to make herself pleasing to the boy; was anxious to be
seen about with him, and yet fearful lest she should
weary him, or he should long for some other companion.
The joy that his presence meant to her was sometimes
more than swallowed up by her jealous fears concerning
him. Had she but known, no such fear need ever have
troubled her life, for Comethup had a genuine and deep
affection for her, born of his gratitude for her many generosities,
and, in greater measure, of his respect for her
strength and force of character. But it was, of course,
impossible for him adequately to express that, and so her
fears never really left her.</p>

<p>With that promptitude which marked all her actions
when her mind was once firmly made up, Miss Carlaw
arranged to close her house and to depart for the Continent
in less than a week. It was a busy week, for clothing
had to be bought, and arrangements made as to their
route, and many other things settled to which only Miss
Carlaw could attend. Comethup went about with his
aunt a great deal, but was often left to his own devices;
and on one of those occasions he made up his mind that
he would go down to the bank and cash the cheque which
his aunt had given him. The matter had completely
slipped his memory before, for there was little need for
him to spend money, and he still had some in his pockets.
He had been with his aunt to the bank once or twice in
earlier years, and remembered well where it was situated.
At the sudden recollection of the large amount of
money he was soon to have in actual cash in his pocket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
he hailed a hansom, immediately after leaving his aunt&rsquo;s
house, and prepared to drive down in state. It seemed
much better fun to the boy&rsquo;s mind to be able to take a
cab, and pay for it, than to order the carriage, as he
could have done at any time.</p>

<p>His foot was on the step of the vehicle when a hand
was clapped on his shoulder, and he heard a familiar
voice ejaculating his name. He turned quickly, and saw
the smiling face of Brian Carlaw. He could not help
noticing, even in that first brief glance, that Brian had
changed in some indefinable fashion, although it was
comparatively but a few days since they had met outside
the school. London seemed to have put its stamp upon
the handsome, reckless face, and in the bold eyes, and
not to their improvement. Brian&rsquo;s dress had always been
careless, but now there was a sheer untidiness about it
that seemed to belong to the change of face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is lucky,&rdquo; exclaimed Brian, gripping his
cousin&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I was just strolling up toward your
place. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have ventured to go in, after my
recollections of our worthy aunt, but I thought I might
get a glimpse of you. And so we flaunt it in hansoms,
do we?&rdquo; He laughed good-humouredly, and slipped his
arm affectionately through Comethup&rsquo;s. &ldquo;In with you.
I&rsquo;ve nothing to claim me at the moment; I&rsquo;ll go wherever
you&rsquo;re going, and you can drop me when I&rsquo;m likely
to be in the way. By Jove! you&rsquo;re a lucky youngster;
and yet I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d change places with you. Where
are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the bank,&rdquo; said Comethup, hastily,
standing up to give the direction to the driver. As he
settled into his place beside Brian he added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully
glad to see you; I&rsquo;ve been thinking a great deal about
you, and wondering what you were doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, I&rsquo;m living&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing. To-day,
perhaps with a few shillings in my pocket; to-morrow
with nothing. No gilded luxury for me; I&rsquo;ve taken Fate
by the throat, and I&rsquo;m going to choke something out of
her. I&rsquo;m only a boy&mdash;not nineteen yet&mdash;a boy, at least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
in years; but I&rsquo;ve read there have been glorious boys
who started as I have done and took the world by storm.
Oh, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m boasting, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m mad. The
days in Sleepy Hollow are done with; I stayed there too
long as it was. In London here&mdash;well, a man may starve,
or walk with broken boots, but everything about him
lives&mdash;<i>lives</i>, I say; every face of man or woman bears the
stamp of a history; every sound, even if it be the sound
of an oath, has life in it. I tell you, it&rsquo;s glorious; one
has only to gird up one&rsquo;s loins, as it were, and join in
the race, and the excitement keeps you going; it must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are you doing?&rdquo; asked Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doing? Everything that&rsquo;s worth doing. Working,
seeing people, dreaming. You&rsquo;ve heard of Chatterton?
He, poor devil, came from Bristol to this wonderful city
when he was about as young as I am; he poisoned himself
in a garret. I promise you I won&rsquo;t do that; life&rsquo;s too
strong in me; and if it comes, as it will, to a rough and
tumble with the world, the world goes down. But I&rsquo;m
working as he worked&mdash;writing. You&rsquo;ll all be proud of
me some day. I&rsquo;ve met men already in these few days
who have begun to encourage me and tell me what I can
do and how to do it. I&rsquo;ve been stringing rhymes for
years&mdash;ever since I was a boy; now I&rsquo;m stringing rhymes
in good earnest. I&rsquo;ve had introductions here, introductions
there; this one has promised to take me up, that
one to see that I&rsquo;m not forgotten. There&rsquo;s a trick in
this as there is in everything else&mdash;the trick of making
people believe in you, making people like you. You&rsquo;ve
got to show yourself a very fine fellow, and to declare
that you <i>are</i> a very fine fellow; if you&rsquo;re loud enough
about it, people will believe you. Here&rsquo;s your bank, you
millionaire. Shall I wait for you, or come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come in, if you like,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>Brian Carlaw was close at his elbow when he presented
the cheque; even laughed easily when Comethup
hesitated a moment as to how he should take the money.
&ldquo;Take it how you will, so that you get it,&rdquo; he suggested.
And when the boy had folded the notes and thrust them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
into his pocket, his cousin linked arms with him again
and drew him out of the bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Comethup, as they
reached the pavement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going?&rdquo; said Brian laughingly. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going
to keep you in sight, youngster; you have no right to
be wandering at large in this dreadful city with all that
money in your pockets. Frankly, I&rsquo;m going to have
lunch with you. My breakfast this morning was a small
affair, and I was casting about in my mind as to how to
obtain a lunch when I met you. Genius always has to
do that kind of thing, you know; it&rsquo;s one of its penalties.
You shall give me the best lunch in town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup could not well refuse; but he was torn between
the thought of this reckless, penniless, hungry
cousin of his, and the remembrance of a certain blind
old woman, to whom he owed everything, sitting in her
solitary dining room and lunching alone and anxiously
awaiting his return. However, before he had time to
think about the matter with any clearness Brian had
thrust him into the waiting cab and had instructed the
driver in a loud voice to drive them somewhere where
they could lunch. &ldquo;The best place in London,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;and look sharp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So this is the way she treats you,&rdquo; said Brian, looking
round at the boy with a smile. &ldquo;Fifty pounds at
one fell swoop! Why, ye gods! it&rsquo;d keep me for a year.
Not that I envy you&mdash;envy isn&rsquo;t in my nature&mdash;only it&rsquo;s
a queer, topsy-turvy world when one man, who doesn&rsquo;t
mean to do anything in particular, has more than he
wants, and another, who wants to set the world ringing,
can scarcely get a crust. There, that&rsquo;s sheer green envy,
isn&rsquo;t it? But what <i>are</i> you going to do? Or have you
made up your mind to live at ease and do nothing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, in a couple of days I&rsquo;m going abroad with my
aunt&mdash;for three years, I believe. We&rsquo;re going to travel
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian Carlaw&rsquo;s face grew grave, and, without making
any reply, he sat for some time almost in moody silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Poor Comethup began to feel guilty; drew a mental picture,
as he was in the habit of doing, of himself travelling
in state and luxury through all the fair places of the
earth, while this clever cousin, who was bound to become
a great man and who craved only fifty pounds for a
whole year, struggled along, in hungry fashion, alone in
London. He counted himself the usurper; wondered, in
all modesty, what his aunt could have found in him to
like so much better than this brilliant youth, who would
surely some day shed glory on her name. In a cumbrous,
boyish, ineffectual way, he strove to think how he
might help this cousin, who was himself so helpless.</p>

<p>The cabman knew his London, and drove them to a
place noted for its cookery and its cellar. Brian quite
naturally led the way, and they found a table in a corner
and seated themselves. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d better leave the
ordering of things to me,&rdquo; he said to Comethup; and the
boy willingly did so.</p>

<p>At the finish of the meal, when Brian had lighted a
cigarette, he leaned across the table to Comethup and
spoke confidentially. The eyes that Comethup thought
were always so beautiful looked with the friendliest,
frankest expression into those of the boy, and his voice
had in it that soft ring of tenderness which made it
almost like the voice&mdash;except that it was deeper and
stronger&mdash;of a woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear old chap,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I talked like a blackguard
to you just now; you&rsquo;re a dear, fine fellow, and I
had no right&mdash;no earthly right&mdash;to envy you your good
luck. We&rsquo;ve always been good friends ever since we
were little fellows, and we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be the worse friends
because one is rich and the other poor. You and I don&rsquo;t
count friendship in that way, do we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer Comethup, unwilling to trust his voice,
stretched his hand across the table; it was immediately
gripped by the hand of the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew what your answer would be,&rdquo; said Brian. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want you to think&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know quite how to
express it&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t want you to think that I&rsquo;m afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
of the future; I&rsquo;ll make as good a fight of it as any one,
perhaps better. Only there&rsquo;s an element in me that isn&rsquo;t
quite&mdash;well, not quite a manly one&mdash;something of the
feminine, I mean; it makes me long for sympathy and
a friend&rsquo;s face and what-not. And that was why, although
you&rsquo;re only a boy, I was somehow rather looking
forward to your being in London; we might have seen
something of each other occasionally; at all events, it
would have been good to know that you were near at
hand. However, you&rsquo;ve got your own life to live, and
you&rsquo;re going to have a good time&mdash;and so am I, for the
matter of that.&rdquo; He threw back his head, crossed his
hands behind it, and laughed softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only this
cursed want of money&mdash;&mdash;There, I&rsquo;m behaving like a
blackguard again, so we&rsquo;ll change the subject. Let&rsquo;s talk&mdash;oh,
of anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flimsy banknotes in Comethup&rsquo;s pocket seemed to
weigh heavier than lead; he thought miserably of all the
luxury with which he was surrounded, of the bowing servants,
the costly furniture, the carriages, everything that
was his for the raising of a finger. And it seemed harder
than ever that Brian&mdash;so gentle, so cheerful, so willing
to take the rough with the smooth&mdash;should have presently
to go out into the world and fight desperately for
actual food. He plunged his hand into his pocket and
pulled out the bundle of notes, and spoke in a choking
voice, &ldquo;Brian&mdash;I&mdash;I say&mdash;Brian&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian, who had been gazing meditatively at the
ceiling, looked across at him, suddenly leaned forward,
with his elbows on the table and his chin on his palms,
and spoke in a surprised tone. &ldquo;Why, Comethup, what&rsquo;s
the matter, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Brian&rdquo;&mdash;he sunk his voice to a whisper
and looked round apprehensively&mdash;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take&mdash;take
all this money, and know that you&mdash;that you haven&rsquo;t a
penny, or scarcely a penny, in the world. You see, Brian,
anything might happen to you. Why, you might actually
starve! It would be horrible. You know I have a great
deal more&mdash;lots more than I can possibly want. No one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
would know anything about it, I promise you. Won&rsquo;t
you take them?&rdquo; He thrust the notes across the table
and pushed them against Brian&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>

<p>Brian changed the position of his head, lowering it
so that his face was hidden by his hands. Comethup saw
emotion in the attitude, and pressed the notes harder
upon him. If he could have seen behind the hand, he
would have known that Brian&rsquo;s dark eyes had suddenly
lighted up with satisfaction, and that his mouth was
working suspiciously, almost as though he were trying to
repress a smile. When, however, after a moment or two
he took his hand from his face and looked across at the
boy, his expression was grave enough, and his mouth
was firm with determination. He shook his head solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, old chap, it&rsquo;s impossible. Remember, I owe you
money already. But for you, I should have starved days
ago. No, I&rsquo;ve got to make a fight for it, and I shall
manage to fall on my feet. I know you can afford it,
and I&rsquo;m awfully grateful, but it isn&rsquo;t fair, and I&rsquo;m not
going to do it.&rdquo; He pushed the notes back again across
the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Brian,&rdquo; urged Comethup, &ldquo;just think for a
moment. I shall be away three years at the least, and I
shall have plenty of money&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;m not boasting about
it, but you know I shall have plenty&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t bear
to think that you may be in straits while I&rsquo;m having a
good time. You say this&rsquo;ll keep you for a year; by that
time you will probably be doing big things. If you don&rsquo;t
like to take it, let it be a loan; if you want to pay me
back, you can&mdash;when you&rsquo;re rich and famous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That point was apparently one which had escaped
Brian. He pondered for a moment, half started forward,
and drew back again, and finally stretched out his hand
with a smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the finest fellow in the world,
Comethup,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and, by Jove! I&rsquo;ll dedicate my first
book to you. You&rsquo;re the only friend I&rsquo;ve really got.
Yes, I&rsquo;ll take the money&mdash;or stay, you&rsquo;d better keep a
fiver of it to pay for the lunch and to keep you swimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
till you get another cheque. You don&rsquo;t know how
happy you&rsquo;ve made me, old boy.&rdquo; He was busily engaged
with the notes, detaching one for five pounds and tossing
it across to Comethup, while he pocketed the others in
businesslike fashion. &ldquo;I shall go home singing like a
lark. By Jove! I&rsquo;ll be able to work now. The fear of
getting up each morning without the prospect of a meal
before you doesn&rsquo;t sharpen your wits, in spite of what
people may say. Look here, I&rsquo;ll give you my address.
You must write to me, dear old chap; and I&rsquo;ll write
to you and let you know all that I&rsquo;m doing. Besides,
I may want to send you this money back; it won&rsquo;t
be long before I repay it, I promise you. Keep
me informed of your movements when you change
from one place to another, and I&rsquo;ll write to you regularly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup paid the bill, and they went out together.
He had quite forgotten about the cab, and it was still
waiting; Brian thrust him in, and stood on the pavement
to say good-bye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t try and thank you, old boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because
such a thing as this is too great for thanks. If ever
you&rsquo;re desperately hard up, you&rsquo;ll know what I feel like
at this moment. You&rsquo;ve got my address; don&rsquo;t forget
to write to me. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They gripped hands, and Brian walked rapidly away,
with that curious half-swagger which was so like his
father&rsquo;s step. Comethup drove home, beginning to wonder
a little as to how he should account to his aunt for
the disappearance of the money in the event of her questioning
him.</p>

<p>He remembered how fixed was her dislike to Brian,
and that, although, as she had said, she had no wish to
control his actions in regard to his cousin, she would
probably not be pleased to know that he had regarded
even her suggestion so lightly. Somewhat quakingly,
therefore, he sought her presence on his return to the
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you rascal,&rdquo; she said, smiling, as she heard his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
step in the room, &ldquo;I suppose you have been running
about town, throwing your money about, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shaft struck home, although she had only spoken
in jest, and Comethup winced. &ldquo;Well, not exactly
throwing it about, aunt,&rdquo; he began; but she checked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, I don&rsquo;t want to know anything about
it. I gave you the money to spend, and I expect you to
do as you like with it. I don&rsquo;t want you to indulge in
wanton waste&mdash;that would be absurd; and I don&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;re likely to do it. But you needn&rsquo;t stint yourself.
And let me know when you want any more. By the way,
as to-morrow is our last real day in town, and there&rsquo;ll
be a good many things to attend to, I think we&rsquo;ll go to
the theatre to-night&mdash;something bright, with music in it.
Would you like to do so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much, aunt,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then; you&rsquo;d better go and see if you can
get a box&mdash;a box is always more comfortable. Now I
want you to learn to please yourself, and to choose for
yourself, and then you&rsquo;ll please me. Just look down this
morning&rsquo;s paper and see what piece you think we should
both like, and then take a hansom&mdash;I heard you drive up
in one just now; I&rsquo;m glad to see you&rsquo;re finding your
way about&mdash;take a hansom, and drive off to the theatre
and get a box for to-night. If you can&rsquo;t get it at one
place, get it at another; you&rsquo;ve got money enough. Get
a big box, near the stage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup tremblingly began to fumble in his pockets.
He had no very distinct idea of what a box would cost,
but he knew it was an expensive matter, and the gold
coins in his pocket were remarkably few. He coughed
and hesitated, and Miss Carlaw began to show signs of
impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you waiting for? Don&rsquo;t you want to
go? For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, boy, don&rsquo;t stand there in that
fashion! Comethup, is anything the matter?&rdquo; Her
voice had changed in a moment, and she came rapidly
across the room to him. &ldquo;Comethup, something has
happened. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, aunt&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m dreadfully sorry, but
how much does a box cost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s that got to do with it? Anything
from two and a half to three guineas, if it&rsquo;s a good one.
What <i>is</i> the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Comethup, slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t
got money enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood quite still for a moment, as if not fully
understanding what he said. &ldquo;Not money enough?&rdquo; she
echoed at last. &ldquo;But, my dear boy, haven&rsquo;t you cashed
the cheque I gave you&mdash;the fifty pounds, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, aunt, I cashed it. But&mdash;I&rsquo;m dreadfully sorry&mdash;there
isn&rsquo;t much of it left&mdash;not enough for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Carlaw whistled softly, and looked
grave. &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I told you you might
spend that money just as you liked, and I&rsquo;m not going
back on my word. But you&rsquo;re a youngster at this game,
evidently, and perhaps I was foolish to give you such a
sum all at once. Fifty pounds is a good deal of money,
and, although I&rsquo;m very rich, you mustn&rsquo;t let it slip quite
so quickly as that, Prince Charming. I don&rsquo;t want you
to tell me anything unless you wish, but, in God&rsquo;s name,
boy, what have you done with it? What have you spent
it on? I told you to do as you liked with it, but for the
life of me I can&rsquo;t think what you&rsquo;ve done with that
money in a matter of two days unless you&rsquo;ve lost it.
Have you lost it, Comethup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Comethup, slowly, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t lost it. I
know it seems&mdash;seems awfully strange, especially as I
only cashed it to-day; I really didn&rsquo;t want it then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some mystery here,&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw, &ldquo;and
I think I ought, for your sake, to get at the bottom of it.
Devil take the money! I don&rsquo;t care a pin about it. But
what have you done with it? Come, you don&rsquo;t mind telling
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Comethup. He had made up his mind that
some explanation must be given. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to tell
you, but I gave it away, or lent it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go on,&rdquo; replied Miss Carlaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave it&mdash;lent it, I mean&mdash;to&mdash;to an old friend.
He was hard up, and he really didn&rsquo;t want to take it. But
he said it would keep him for a year&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor devil!&rdquo; ejaculated Miss Carlaw under her
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I wanted to help him, so I made him take it.
I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you; you know I never have anything
to spend money on, and I thought I should be able
to get along with what I had for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Carlaw turned away abruptly and pulled out
her purse. Twisting round toward him again, she held
it out, even shook it at him. &ldquo;Here, take this. Oh, my
dear boy, I&rsquo;m an old fool, and you&rsquo;re probably a young
one; but, upon my word, I think you&rsquo;re making me love
you more every day. It was a lot of money to give any
one, but you&rsquo;re quite right, and I hope I should have done
the same myself. Here, take this, and go and see about
the box. There&rsquo;s money enough there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d rather not take any more money, aunt, thank
you; not yet, at least. I don&rsquo;t want it, and I can just
as well wait a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you take it? Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>She laughed, very well pleased, and came nearer to
him. &ldquo;Here, take it,&rdquo; she urged gently, &ldquo;and pay for
the box and your cab, at least. Lord! I love your obstinacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup took the purse and kissed her, feeling very
guilty, and went out to do her bidding.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="subheading">COMETHUP IS SHADOWED.</p>


<p>Comethup, sitting in solemn state with his aunt in
a great box which would comfortably have held six, could
not quite get rid of that guilty feeling he had of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
deceived her. It was certainly the first time, but, despite
the difference in their ages and dispositions, and despite
the relationship existing between them, they had hitherto
been in all things friends; there was a fine comradeship
between the old woman and the boy&mdash;a comradeship
which had demanded complete confidence on his part
and equal trust on hers. Having nothing to conceal, his
life had been like an open book to her, and she had read
the book eagerly and with satisfaction. Now, for the
first time, it had become necessary that he should deceive
her; that, however justly, he should use her money
for a purpose of which she would not have approved.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he thought with very genuine
sympathy and affection of Brian, the boy who seemed
destined to make so much more of life than Comethup
could hope to do; who was in every sense, he thought,
made of better and finer stuff. He remembered how he
had said that fifty pounds would keep him beyond the
reach of want for a year in London, and trembled a little
to think how small a sum fifty pounds really meant; he
found himself doing disturbing sums in division in his
head, and figuring out how much lay between Brian and
starvation every week.</p>

<p>In an interval between the acts, when the lights were
turned fully on in the theatre, he leaned out over the
edge of the box and carelessly looked at the people below.
Not a few glasses were levelled at him, and not a
few whispers went round concerning the identity of the
handsome boy who sat in the big box with the old woman
with the closed eyes. Gazing beneath him at the rows of
stalls, he suddenly caught his breath and drew back; then
leaned over again in some amazement. Beneath him,
seated beside a lady in evening dress, was Brian Carlaw.</p>

<p>Comethup&rsquo;s exclamation had not been unnoticed by
his aunt. &ldquo;Some one you know?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not quite sure,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;I think
I&rsquo;ll go round and see, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s anybody
nice, bring &rsquo;em here; if you think they&rsquo;ll bore me, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Comethup made his way down to the stalls, and came
face to face with Brian, who was coming out. Brian
looked confused for a moment, and then extended his
hand. &ldquo;My dear old boy, this is delightful. Twice in
one day; there&rsquo;s a fate in it. I dare say you&rsquo;re surprised
to see me here; but, as a matter of fact, it&rsquo;s a piece of
speculation. There&rsquo;s a woman&rdquo;&mdash;he jerked his head to
indicate the lady whose side he had quitted&mdash;&ldquo;who&rsquo;s very
good fun, and very useful. She&rsquo;s taken rather a fancy
to this budding versifier, and I think it&rsquo;s probable that
she may be able to do something for me. At all events,
she&rsquo;s a useful person to know. So you see, as it&rsquo;s no use
hoping to do anything in this world without taking risks,
your money enabled me to secure a couple of stalls to-night;
to bring her down here in style&mdash;in a word, to
make a good impression. My dear boy, it&rsquo;ll pay; depend
upon it, it&rsquo;ll pay well. I told you this morning that I
was learning the trick of the whole business; it&rsquo;s as easy
as winking when you know it, and I think it&rsquo;ll carry me
through anything. You may sit and write and starve
in your garret forever, and do not a ha&rsquo;porth of good;
you&rsquo;ve got to come out of your garret and cut a good
figure if people are to believe you. I&rsquo;m beginning to
like the game; I am, indeed. Come and have a cigarette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup hastily declined, murmured something
about how glad he was to see Brian again, and went back
to his aunt&rsquo;s box. He hoped, and indeed believed, that
it was all right; but a little curious feeling of doubt in
regard to Brian came into his mind, and would not be
dispelled. He watched his cousin and the lady who was
with him during the evening; noticed that Brian sat very
close to her and whispered; observed that she talked in
loud tones and laughed somewhat immoderately, and
made considerable play with a huge feather fan. He
had, too, to begin a new calculation in regard to the
money with which he had supplied Brian; found it necessary
to deduct from it the price of two stalls and an approximate
amount for cabs, and then to redivide the
sum remaining by fifty-two; Brian&rsquo;s income for a year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
looked meagre indeed. Miss Charlotte Carlaw made inquiries
concerning his friend, but Comethup put her off
with an evasive reply.</p>

<p>On the following day the final arrangements were
made, and they started for the Continent. Miss Charlotte
Carlaw had carried the whole matter through with
such energy, and in so short a space of time, that there
had been no time to inform the captain, but Comethup
wrote him a long letter from Paris, on the first day of
their arrival there, breaking to him, as gently as possible,
the intelligence that they would not be likely to meet
for at least three years. The boy thought sometimes, in
those early days, that he would have been glad to get
back again to the old-fashioned town in which he had
been born, and to narrow down his world&mdash;which had
widened so much recently, and was widening every day&mdash;to
the captain and &rsquo;Linda and the few others who had
known and loved him as a child. But he blamed himself
the next instant for his ingratitude.</p>

<p>They spent quite a long time in Paris&mdash;nearly two
months&mdash;and at the end of the first month a surprising
event occurred.</p>

<p>He was passing one day through the large hall of the
hotel at which they were stopping, with his aunt&rsquo;s hand
resting on his arm, when he observed a young man, whose
back was toward him, making some inquiries of a servant.
The attitude and gestures seemed familiar. As he passed
with his aunt toward the staircase he glanced back over
his shoulder and saw that the young man had turned
and was looking hesitatingly at him. It was his cousin,
Brian Carlaw.</p>

<p>Brian made a half-movement toward him, and then
looked at the unconscious Charlotte Carlaw, made a
comical grimace, and shook his head. As Comethup
went on up the stairs, still looking back at the other in
perplexity, Brian stepped forward softly and motioned
to him to come down again and join him there. Comethup
nodded, and continued his way upstairs. He
conducted his aunt to her room, and then hurried down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
again to Brian. That young man received him rapturously,
and airily plunged into an explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear old boy, you know you wrote to me, like the
good fellow you are, and told me where you were staying.
I don&rsquo;t mind confessing that at first I was wild with
envy. Thought I, &lsquo;Paris is the place for inspiration, for
beauty, the very home of a poet.&rsquo; And then I thought:
&lsquo;No, my boy; you&rsquo;ve got your work to do, and, gray
skies or blue, sunshine or rain, you must do it.&rsquo; And I
do assure you, old fellow, that I went at it hammer and
tongs; I did indeed. Can&rsquo;t we go into the smoking room
or somewhere and have a chat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup led the way into a corner of the room
and they sat down. He began to be a little frightened at
the business&mdash;a little afraid of this harlequin cousin, who
was forever springing upon him, and whose presence he
must keep secret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then, while I worked,&rdquo; pursued Brian, &ldquo;and I
give you my word I <i>did</i> work, away went the money.
You&rsquo;ve no idea what it is in London; you&rsquo;ve had some
one to provide everything for you&mdash;I had to provide for
myself. And then I found that the days of genius out-at-elbows
are gone past; genius must be well dressed now,
and make something of a figure, or he&rsquo;ll be mistaken for
a beggar. It would take too long to explain, but the
thing has to be done; it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. And so&rdquo;&mdash;with
a smile and a shrug of his shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;the money
went.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of it?&rdquo; asked Comethup, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of it. I know it seems a lot, but there it is&mdash;or
rather there it isn&rsquo;t. Dear old boy&rdquo;&mdash;he leaned affectionately
nearer to Comethup&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose we poor devils
who live by our wits don&rsquo;t take life quite in the same
way as a more sober citizen might do. I can&rsquo;t account for
it, but if you look back, as I have done, over the histories
of any men who&rsquo;ve made anything of a stir in the world,
you&rsquo;ll find they were improvident, thriftless rascals, who
never ought to have been trusted with a penny. They
ought to have been given two suits of clothes a year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
without any pockets, and fed by the state. It&rsquo;s a horrible
condition of things, that a man who&rsquo;s doing work
that he hopes will live should have to fight and beg for
bread and butter. There, it&rsquo;s no use moralizing; that&rsquo;s
what I told myself two days ago in London, when I&rsquo;d
come down to the last five-pound note. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Comethup,&rsquo;
said I; &lsquo;Comethup is a dear good chap, with
plenty of money and nothing to do with it; Comethup
knows what I&rsquo;m going to do, and how I&rsquo;m working, and
all my hopes and plans; Comethup won&rsquo;t see me fall to
the ground.&rsquo; So here I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Comethup sat for a moment in silence. He felt
the delicacy and yet at the same time the falseness of
the position in which he stood. With that feeling which
was always strongest in him&mdash;the desire not to wound
any one&rsquo;s feelings&mdash;he was prompted now to put the matter
as gently as possible; but an explanation must be
given, and given firmly. After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he
looked round at Brian with a troubled face; Brian, for
his part, was smiling and quite at ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Brian,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I want to help you
very much; I should really feel much happier if you had
the money altogether. But then my aunt&mdash;<i>our</i> aunt, I
should say&mdash;has been very good to me, and has never
denied me anything. The money I lent you before was
hers, and as she&mdash;well, as she doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t like me, you mean,&rdquo; broke in Brian, with a
laugh. &ldquo;Oh, I know that quite well; and I can assure
you I haven&rsquo;t the least respect for <i>her</i>. What were you
going to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as she doesn&rsquo;t like you, I couldn&rsquo;t, of course,
tell her exactly where the money had gone, although she
wanted to know. I didn&rsquo;t tell her quite the truth about
it, and it made me feel frightfully mean. You know, if
the money were my own, you should have as much as you
wanted at any time; as it isn&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t seem quite
fair to her, does it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! I don&rsquo;t see it in that light at all,&rdquo; replied
Brian. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll give you anything you like to ask,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
and she&rsquo;s got plenty, and you have the satisfaction of
knowing that you&rsquo;re helping a poor devil to fame and
fortune. My dear boy, it&rsquo;ll all be paid back some day,
every penny of it; there&rsquo;s not the least doubt about that.
I&rsquo;ve got my chance now, but I shall lose it, as sure as fate,
if I can&rsquo;t get some money. Hang it all, old chap, you
wouldn&rsquo;t leave me stranded in Paris without a penny
while you live on the fat of the land and drive about in
a carriage? You couldn&rsquo;t do it, Comethup; you&rsquo;re not
that sort of a fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t my money,&rdquo; said Comethup with a groan.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand that? I think she ought to
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her, then,&rdquo; said Brian, with a short laugh, &ldquo;and
see what&rsquo;ll happen. You know perfectly well that she&rsquo;ll
refuse to allow you to give me another penny; you admit
she doesn&rsquo;t like me, and she doesn&rsquo;t care whether I go
to the dogs or not. What&rsquo;s the use of talking such nonsense
as that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Comethup, &ldquo;and of
course I can&rsquo;t let you go about without any money, especially
in a strange city. But I haven&rsquo;t very much with
me&mdash;only about twenty pounds&mdash;and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, twenty pounds means more to me than
you can understand; it&rsquo;s a fortune. Twenty pounds will
positively save me. You&rsquo;ve been used to such a lot that
it doesn&rsquo;t seem much to you, but to me&mdash;ye gods! twenty
pounds banishes dull care and puts me on the high road
to fortune. And let me tell you this: I mean to be careful
this time; I&rsquo;m working, as I&rsquo;ve told you, and, until
I see the results of my work, I ask no more assistance
from you or any one; to that I pledge my word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup handed over the money, and Brian gripped
the hand that gave it to him fervently for a moment.
&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; he said, in a voice of emotion, &ldquo;some day
you will understand more fully what you have done. I
don&rsquo;t know how to thank you, old chap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t say anything about that,&rdquo; replied
Comethup hastily. &ldquo;Are you going back to London?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shall stay in Paris for a day or two; it&rsquo;s just
a good chance to have a look round, and see what the
wonderful place is like; I shall do it cheaply, never fear.
By the way,&rdquo; he added, as he rose from his seat, &ldquo;did
I tell you that dad is over here? Followed me to London,
and we had an affecting reconciliation&mdash;tears and all that
sort of business. So as I was coming over here he said
he&rsquo;d come too; couldn&rsquo;t bear to be parted from me. I
suppose&rdquo;&mdash;this with a laugh&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose I treated the
dear old chap rather badly, and I&rsquo;m glad to be friends
with him again; he&rsquo;s not a bad sort, take him altogether.
Perhaps you&rsquo;d better not tell your aunt that we&rsquo;re here;
she doesn&rsquo;t love either of us. Good-bye. I won&rsquo;t ask you
to save me again, old chap. Write and let me know where
you go, and when; the old address in London will find me.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup, in his bed that night, after much anxious
thought came to a resolution. He fully and firmly made
up his mind not to write to Brian again. Had the matter
rested solely with himself, he could not have formed such
a resolve; but he thought of his aunt, and knowing that
it was impossible to tell her anything of the matter, he
saw clearly that his duty to her was to keep away from
Brian. Boy though he was, and great though his admiration
was for his cousin, he yet saw clearly enough into the
matter to know that Brian would light-heartedly come
to him again and again without any thought of the
future. It was with a great sense of relief that he heard
his aunt next morning declare that they would leave Paris
within a few days.</p>

<p>But his troubles were not at an end. Miss Charlotte
Carlaw complained that he was moody and silent, and
strove in her own kindly fashion to discover what was the
matter. &ldquo;I can see what it is,&rdquo; she said abruptly one
morning; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the wrong sort of companion for you. I
ought to have known it; I should have been wiser than
to tie you to the apron strings of a blind old woman in
this fashion. It&rsquo;s been a mistake, and you must forgive
me, boy. While I&rsquo;ve been wanting to have you near me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ve lost sight of the fact that you, being young and
strong, would probably want to be capering about the
city alone and having a good time. Well, I warned you
what it would be before we started, and you see I was
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, aunt,&rdquo; said Comethup eagerly, &ldquo;you are
quite mistaken. I&rsquo;m sorry if I have seemed to be bothered
about anything; but I&rsquo;m not, really, and you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
have to complain again. I&rsquo;m quite sure no one could
have a better time than I am having.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not quite satisfied, and I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve
really been very selfish about the matter. For Heaven&rsquo;s
sake, boy, if there&rsquo;s anything you want, or want to do,
within reason, say what it is! Or if anything is troubling
you, you&rsquo;re surely not afraid of an old woman who&rsquo;s tried
to be your friend and who would give a great deal to save
you any sorrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course not,&rdquo; replied the boy quickly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you in a moment if there&rsquo;s anything I want or&mdash;or
if there&rsquo;s anything troubling me. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re going
away from Paris, because I&rsquo;ve got just a little tired of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be off to-morrow,&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw, with decision.
&ldquo;Now, just to please me, forget for an hour or
two that I exist at all; off with you where you will, and
don&rsquo;t get into mischief. In fact, I&rsquo;ll give you the day to
yourself, and if you come near me at all I shall be very
angry. I can contrive to amuse myself alone for once.
Here&rsquo;s money for you; lunch well, dine well, do what you
like. Off with you; I don&rsquo;t want to hear your voice till
nightfall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup somewhat reluctantly set off into the city.
But it was a fine day, and the brightness of everything
about him&mdash;the moving people, the life and animation of
the city&mdash;all had their effect upon him. He was quite
glad to be alone for once; he seated himself on a bench in
some gardens in the sunshine and folded his arms and
sat looking out at the world before him through half-closed
eyelids and with a smile about his mouth, for he
was very young, and the world seemed very fair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>He began to dream lazily about his old friends: wondered
what the captain was doing at that hour, and almost
pictured him strolling across the sandy wastes with
&rsquo;Linda by his side. He was glad to think of &rsquo;Linda; glad
to remember her as he had seen her last, a pretty girlish
figure, at the gate of the captain&rsquo;s garden. With all the
bustle and noise of Paris about him, with strange tongues
chattering and strange figures moving past him, he
seemed to see, in a vision, the old place of his childhood
in another atmosphere and another light; held it, as it
were, in a sacred and secret place in his remembrance&mdash;a
thing apart.</p>

<p>One of the figures that flitted vaguely before him
stopped and appeared to draw back a pace and then to
advance. Comethup opened his eyes fully and stared up
at the figure. A familiar voice greeted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, dear nephew! How I have longed and
hoped to see you! What has my cry been these past days,
since I learned that you were in Paris? &lsquo;Comethup,&rsquo;
and yet again &lsquo;Comethup.&mdash;Show me Comethup,&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;and let me look into his eyes, and I am a happy man!&rsquo;
And now my wish is granted; more than all, I find you
alone. My dear boy!&rdquo; He grasped Comethup fervently
by the hand and sank upon the bench beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard you were in Paris,&rdquo; said Comethup; &ldquo;Brian
told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that misguided boy! But still I love him. Who
could help loving him? We have had our differences;
we have even used harsh words to each other. But all
that, I trust, is forgotten and forgiven. When I heard
that he was coming to Paris, and coming, above all things,
to see you, I said at once that I would go with him; my
place was by his side, and, as I have told you, I longed
to see my nephew. Boy&rdquo;&mdash;he looked with affectionate
sternness at Comethup&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not looking well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m very well, thank you; only a little tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw shook his head plaintively. &ldquo;Ah,
the weight of wealth, the responsibility of it! I am sometimes
glad in my heart that Providence saw fit to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
me poor; I have known my sorrows, but I have known my
joys also. Wealth is a great responsibility. My dear
sister is well, I trust?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she&rsquo;s quite well,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause for some moments, and
then Mr. Carlaw, with something of an effort, turned toward
his nephew. &ldquo;My dear Comethup,&rdquo; he said, prefacing
his speech with a hastily suppressed sigh, &ldquo;Fortune
has been very good to you and has made you, if one may
say so, her favourite child; has taken you from an obscurity
(which I am sure was quite unmerited) and has
placed you in affluence. If I did not think you were wise
beyond your years I should not speak to you as I do now;
but I know that Fortune has not blunted your sympathies,
and that you are still the generous-hearted boy I
knew in years gone by. Comethup, look well upon me&rdquo;&mdash;he
stuck his hands in the breast of his frock coat and
looked gloomily at the boy&mdash;&ldquo;and tell me what I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup looked at him in some amazement. &ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re
my Uncle Robert, of course,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me Bob,&rdquo; said Mr. Carlaw, with some emotion.
&ldquo;My friends have always called me Bob; had they called
me by any other name it might have been better for me.
But Bob was a good fellow; Bob had his hand in his
pocket for a friend; Bob hadn&rsquo;t the slightest notion of
that simple word &lsquo;no&rsquo;; in short, Bob, in the world&rsquo;s eyes,
has been going straight to the devil since he was breeched.
Boy&rdquo;&mdash;he laid his hand on Comethup&rsquo;s arm, and Comethup
felt that he trembled with agitation&mdash;&ldquo;boy, your Uncle
Bob has finished his course; your Uncle Bob is a bankrupt
and an outlaw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a few moments Comethup was too much shocked to
say anything; he sat still, staring helplessly at his uncle,
whose head was bowed in a forlorn fashion. He murmured
something at last about being very sorry, and Mr.
Carlaw felt for his hand and pressed it without looking
at him or speaking. Rallying a little presently, the forlorn
one raised his head and endeavoured to smile, and
looked out hopefully upon the prospect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sunshine&mdash;and sympathy; what can a man want
more? You&rsquo;re young, Comethup, in the ways of the
world&mdash;I had almost said simple; the world will try to
take advantage of you; will rob you with one hand while
it fawns upon you with the other. Beware of it; take
your own path straight through life, and trouble not
about what any man may say. It&rsquo;s the only way,&rdquo; he
added gloomily; &ldquo;would that I had remembered it in
time! For myself, although they have made me a beggar,
I care nothing; a crust of bread and a cup of water are
all that I ask of any man, and they will probably deny me
those. But, my boy, I have responsibilities&mdash;I have a
son.&rdquo; Here his emotion appeared quite to overmaster
him for an instant, and Comethup felt very sorry for him
indeed. After a few moments he slapped his breast firmly
and coughed, blinked his eyelids, and looked upon the
boy with a ghostly smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Brian will make his way&mdash;will get on, I
mean,&rdquo; said Comethup, in the hope of encouraging him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make his way! Get on! You are right; you are
very right. The time will surely come when his name will
be echoed to the skies; when that which is pent in his
father and has found no proper outlet will appear in the
son, and gladden the father&rsquo;s heart. It is there; I have
proudly watched the beginnings of it; I have, in my poor
way, fostered the first trembling attempts. But what is
the case&mdash;how do we stand? Again comes in the damnable
thought of money&mdash;money, without which we can do
nothing. Like those of commoner clay, we must live&mdash;we
must eat&mdash;we must have fire to warm us&mdash;a roof to
shelter us. And here, at the very outset of my son&rsquo;s
career, I find myself a beggar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He beat his foot restlessly upon the ground, and
turned away his head and bit his lip in the struggle to
hide his feelings. Comethup in a dim way began to be
pretty certain what was coming, but he was desperately
sorry for the man, nevertheless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now and then, in our dreary way through a horrible
world, we come upon one human soul that has sympathy&mdash;nay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
that has a heart of gold; it&rsquo;s rare, but still we find it.
There is one such heart of gold in this city to-day. Listen:
my son came here practically penniless; we looked
into each other&rsquo;s eyes; we were big with hope, but still we
were penniless. Suddenly my son returns to me with
money&mdash;with what is, to us, a large sum. Delicacy
forbids my asking whence it came; my son informs
me that a friend&mdash;I repeat the word with emphasis&mdash;a
friend has insisted upon helping him. His delicacy is as
great as mine; he refuses to say more, and I&mdash;well, I do
not press him. But in my heart I know&mdash;oh, my dear
boy, let us drop parables; let me thank you as one man
may thank another. I am broken, friendless, an outcast;
yet my heart is still strong and true; my feelings, pray
God, are those of a gentleman. I may tramp the highways
to-morrow without a crust, but still I trust men
may turn to look at me and say, &lsquo;There goes a gentleman.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said it with an air, even with something of the
old flourish, and Comethup was considerably impressed.
After some silence, Mr. Robert Carlaw got up, with a
sigh, and turned toward his nephew and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This has done me good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I come into
your fresh, buoyant, rich young life; I touch again the
things that might have been; I renew, as it were, my
youth. Our paths lie in different directions; you sweep
along the broad highway, and the dust&mdash;yes, the dust&mdash;of
your chariot wheels shall be flung over me as I walk.
That is fate, that is life. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took his nephew&rsquo;s hand in both his own for a
moment, sighed heavily, and turned away. In less than
a minute he was back again. There was hesitation in his
manner and he shifted his feet uneasily, yet he spoke with
a desperate boldness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear friend, I&mdash;I have put off what I have to
say&mdash;put it off in the hope that I might not have to say
it. My courage deserts me; it is not easy for a man who
has carried his head high before his fellows to lower it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and to beg. Do not misunderstand me,&rdquo; he added hastily,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis not for myself; if it were for myself the petition
should never be urged. It is for another&mdash;it is for my
son. Comethup, it is necessary, in order that we may
get our affairs somewhat straight, that we should leave
this city. My son has money, but he needs it for his
work&mdash;he may even need it for food. Can I go to him
and say to him&mdash;can I, his father, say it to him, &lsquo;Brian, I
am penniless; I have not sufficient money to bear me to
my native land&rsquo;? This may seem a mere matter of cowardice;
but, broken and outcast though I am, I would still
carry myself well in the eyes of my son; I would still
have him say, &lsquo;This is my father, of whom I am proud,
and who has never shamed me yet.&rsquo; It is, I think, a
natural thought, a natural wish. Frankly, as man to
man, will you help me to do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup felt that, under the circumstances, there
was but one thing to be done. He put his hand in his
pocket and pulled out the money his aunt had given
him. &ldquo;How much would you want, sir?&rdquo; he asked slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to be businesslike, may I say ten pounds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup was rather glad he wanted no more, because
the loss of that sum would still leave something
in his own pockets so that it might not be necessary for
him to apply to his aunt. He handed Mr. Robert Carlaw
the amount specified, and Mr. Carlaw shook hands with
him many times and blessed him, and finally walked away
with a jaunty step.</p>

<p>Comethup dined sparingly, and wandered about the
city for the greater part of the day. He returned to the
hotel in the evening, and found his aunt sitting alone; he
was informed that she had asked if he had returned several
times during the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, young scapegrace!&rdquo; she exclaimed as he entered,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind confessing I&rsquo;ve missed you horribly;
and I suppose you&rsquo;ve been tearing round the city and
flinging your money about, and making people wonder
who the young English gentleman is, and where he gets
his money from, and what he&rsquo;s doing alone in a wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
city, eh? Oh, you&rsquo;ve been doing the thing royally, I&rsquo;ll
be bound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup thought of the modest dinner he had eaten
in a small <i>café</i>, and of how for the rest he had wandered
about the streets in lonely fashion for many hours; but
there was a fiction to be kept up, and he laughed and
said he was afraid he had spent a great deal of money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind; it won&rsquo;t do any harm, once in a
way. You&rsquo;re inclined to be a bit reckless, Prince Charming,
but I suppose that&rsquo;s my fault. Most of the money
gone, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; said Comethup. He saw that this
was the clearest and best fashion to get out of the difficulty&mdash;to
take to himself a character for extravagance
which he did not possess; it would save the necessity for
any explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so that you&rsquo;ve had a good time, I don&rsquo;t mind.
I must find you some more to-morrow; I only want you
to enjoy yourself and to be straightforward, and keep
nothing from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup awoke with a lighter heart the next morning&mdash;lighter,
perhaps, because Paris was to be left behind.
He was glad to think that he had got well over his difficulties;
almost glad, too, to think that he had seen the
last of Mr. Robert Carlaw. Of his feelings toward Brian
he was not quite so certain; he pitied him very much,
and hoped earnestly that Fortune and Fame were indeed
holding out their hands to him. But he was but a boy,
who had lived his simple life hitherto simply and straightforwardly
and well, with nothing to conceal. Now, for
the first time, with however good a purpose, he was deceiving
one whom he knew to be his greatest and most
loyal friend&mdash;one but for whose loyal assistance life could
never have been to him the full and splendid thing it had
been.</p>

<p>But he had not seen the last of his uncle by any
means. As he went down the steps of the hotel, with his
aunt leaning on his arm, toward the vehicle which waited
to take them to the station, a figure suddenly sprang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
forward and thrust aside the servant who held the door.
As the unconscious Miss Carlaw stepped into the carriage
her brother bent his head reverently, appeared
almost to be silently blessing her. The wonderful Robert
was evidently possessed with a deep gratitude for which
Comethup would scarcely have given him credit. It was,
of course, impossible for the boy to speak; he could only
look entreatingly at the man and beg him by signs to go
away.</p>

<p>But Uncle Robert knew better than that. While the
luggage was being piled upon the vehicle he flung himself
eagerly into the most menial offices&mdash;the lifting of boxes
and the final closing of the carriage door; then, when all
was completed, he actually climbed upon the box seat beside
the driver, folded his arms, and accompanied them
to the station.</p>

<p>At the station it was just as bad. Poor Comethup
lived in torments until the train actually steamed away,
for Mr. Robert Carlaw got in the way of porters and
assisted them, to their astonishment, in disposing of the
luggage, and was altogether a very elegant and ridiculous
millstone round the boy&rsquo;s neck. Finally, as the train
departed, he stood in an attitude of deep dejection, with
his hat in his hand, watching them as they moved out of
his sight.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="subheading">THE BEGINNINGS OF A GENIUS.</p>


<p>The three years of wandering had stretched into four,
and thence into five. It would have been under ordinary
circumstances a happy, irresponsible time enough, for they
took their journeyings haphazard, staying in a place for
months at a time if it pleased them, or but a few days
if they did not like it; they had every luxury and comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
and convenience that money could purchase; they
stayed always in the best places and travelled in the best
manner. Yet throughout it all there had hung, floating
before him wherever he went, an ever-growing cloud of
deceit and trickery about Comethup. Dread seemed to
mark the most cloudless day, and he never entered a
strange city or village without looking with anxious eyes
at every passing tourist.</p>

<p>Throughout those five years it is safe to say that
Comethup had never been wholly free from the presence
of Robert Carlaw and his son. First the one and then
the other; then both together; then the one, with a
piteous tale of the other&rsquo;s deceit; and the other, with
a story of how badly the one had treated him. Comethup
never quite knew whether they travelled in company
or whether they merely kept touch with each
other&rsquo;s movements and met at intervals; at all events,
they seemed to know pretty clearly the route taken by
Comethup and his aunt, and the dates of their departure
from various places. Indeed, Miss Carlaw and her
nephew were easy of identification, for they travelled
in state; and each was a noticeable figure and attracted
attention in different ways. The blind old woman, travelling
through beautiful places for pleasure, was a subject
for sympathy; the handsome youth who was her constant
attendant, and who carried his grave face through
so many different scenes, and who appeared always so
devoted to her, won the admiration of many people whose
names he never knew and to whom he scarcely spoke.</p>

<p>Once or twice Comethup had felt with growing relief
that the Carlaws, father and son, were gone; a month
or two would pass and nothing be seen of them. And
then one morning, in a strange city, the horizon would
be darkened to him by the swing of Uncle Robert&rsquo;s coat-tails;
or his day would be changed and troubled by the
sudden appearance of Brian, alert and eager and full of
wild hopes as ever. The daring and resource of Mr. Robert
Carlaw knew no bounds. On more than one occasion,
in crowded streets, he actually walked on the farther side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
of his sister, bending forward to glance at Comethup
and to smile and nod to him as though to assure the boy
of his protection. On such occasions Miss Carlaw would
embarrassingly let fall some remark, perhaps even touching
Robert himself, all unconscious of the figure that
stalked beside her. With that air of protection large
upon him, he turned up in the most unexpected places,
and his errand was always the same.</p>

<p>As degrading things degrade a man, so Robert Carlaw
lost something of the old, reckless swagger&mdash;the fine
air with which he had carried himself before the world.
He did not come less boldly on that account when he
made his shameful plea again and again to Comethup;
but he came to make it, in time, more as a matter
of course&mdash;a something to which he had the right. He
must have had some small money of his own, or
must have begged and borrowed elsewhere during those
years; all that he squeezed out of Comethup could not
have enabled him to travel as he did or live in the style
he did.</p>

<p>Once or twice, as has been said, father and son presented
themselves together; they had made up their differences
and henceforth nothing was to separate them;
their interests went hand in hand, as did their hopes and
ambitions. On such occasions Mr. Robert Carlaw would
announce, not without emotion, that life held new purposes
for him. Comethup even saw him once turn up the
sleeve of his coat and mutter something about work.
Brian would laugh and clap his father on the shoulder,
and cry that he was a good fellow and that they&rsquo;d stand
or fall together.</p>

<p>But in a day or two one or the other would make his
appearance alone; would tell his tale of the desertion of
that being who should have held to him, if only for the
ties of blood; would plead that the deserter, in a moment
of forgetfulness or duplicity, had taken the available
capital, and would beg for further help. In one case it
would be the father whom Brian in a sudden fit of petulance
had deserted; in another case Brian would cry out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
upon his unnatural parent who had, theoretically at least,
cursed him, and left him to starve.</p>

<p>So the game had gone merrily on until Comethup had
grown quite used to it, and was only glad that he could
keep the thing so successfully from his aunt&rsquo;s knowledge.
During those years Brian had not been altogether idle;
he had produced two slim books of verse, which had found
considerable favour with a certain section of the public,
and which had got him pretty considerably talked about,
if no more. He declared to Comethup that from a
monetary standpoint the things were valueless; that they
brought him fame, but that he had discovered that a year
or two must elapse before he could really hope to live by
his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I make a sudden hit; that, of
course, would make a difference&mdash;would fling me to the
top of the tree at a bound. Then, old fellow, my first
duty would be to repay every penny&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;ve made a
careful calculation, and have got it all jotted down somewhere&mdash;every
penny I owe you. As a matter of fact, I
may see something to-morrow which will give me just
the right thought&mdash;may write the thing red hot, as it
were&mdash;and make my fortune. And you&rsquo;ll have the satisfaction,
dear old boy, of knowing that&mdash;indirectly, of
course&mdash;you&rsquo;ve brought it about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, although the books were produced, and although
they were well spoken of, and although Brian paid one or
two flying visits to London &ldquo;to stir up the publishers,&rdquo;
as he expressed it, it all seemed to make no difference to
the position of affairs so far as Comethup was concerned,
and that position remained unaltered. It practically
amounted to this: that Comethup was certain that within
a given time one of them or both would smilingly or
tearfully appear in a strange city without funds and
dependent on his bounty. Under those circumstances it
became, of course, impossible to turn a deaf ear to their
entreaties, and they had to be relieved.</p>

<p>Comethup gained a reputation for reckless extravagance
that he did not in the least deserve. Personally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Miss Charlotte Carlaw was not displeased, although she
was sometimes puzzled to understand how he spent his
money, but she adhered to her principle and trusted him
absolutely, never questioning him upon anything about
which he seemed disinclined to speak. She had had her
dearest wish realized in gaining the love of this boy; he
was devoted to her, and had been more than a mere companion;
he had been, as she had once suggested, eyes to
her&mdash;had made her darkened journey something so full
of colour and brightness that it became under his young
influence more wonderful than any journey she had ever
taken before.</p>

<p>During those years Comethup had kept up something
of a correspondence with the old captain; had filled his
own letters with glowing accounts of the places he visited,
and his impressions of them; and had received from the
captain, in return, such small news as he had to communicate
about his simple and uneventful life. In one
of the letters, soon after they had started for the Continent,
the captain had corroborated Mr. Robert Carlaw&rsquo;s
account of his bankruptcy; had told&mdash;perhaps with something
of grim satisfaction&mdash;of the selling of all the beautiful
things contained in the house which Comethup had
visited as a boy, together with a full description of how
Mr. Carlaw had stood outside the house during the
progress of the sale in an utterly dejected attitude; and
of how the poor gentleman had received a vast amount of
respectful sympathy on account of his ruin. Comethup,
in reply to the letter, had very properly expressed his sorrow;
but in no subsequent letter did he tell the captain
of his frequent meetings with the father and the son. He
felt that it would be wiser to maintain absolute silence in
regard to the matter.</p>

<p>So nearly five years had slipped away, and Comethup,
looking back as over a crowded page across the track
of their wanderings, could find it in his heart to be very
grateful for all that had happened; very grateful, too,
in his simple, unselfish fashion, that he had been able,
after all, to help the two who had so often pleaded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
him. True, he was a little frightened at the remembrance
that Miss Charlotte Carlaw&rsquo;s bounty had enabled
four people to run about the Continent for some years,
instead of only two, as she had imagined. But that was
done with now, and he had already started with his aunt
on the homeward journey, and the two he pitied so much,
and yet dreaded so much to see, were left behind.</p>

<p>Instructions had been given, and all arrangements
made, so that their house was perfectly in order for their
return. It seemed quite a lifetime to Comethup Willis
since he had left that house behind and set out, a mere
boy, on his travels with his aunt. Yet, despite all the
sunny places he had visited, it was good to get back to
the gray old city again; good to know that he was in
sober England and within a short journey of the old
place where the captain lived, and where all the hallowed
associations of his own boyhood were gathered together.</p>

<p>There was much to be done in the first week of their
return&mdash;friends to visit, and many matters which required
attention after so long an absence. But at the end of the
week Miss Carlaw called Comethup to her one evening,
when they were alone after dinner, and bade him sit down
near her. For quite a long time, while she rocked herself
softly over the head of her stick in the old fashion, she
was silent; at last she raised her head and turned her
face toward him. He thought, as he looked at her, how
little change the years had wrought in her; save for a
few added lines, the face was the same strong, kindly
one that he had seen first as a little child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;you know that to-morrow is
an eventful day, don&rsquo;t you? Or have you forgotten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup laughed and blushed, and assured her that
he had not forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow you put aside boyish things&mdash;I think you
did that some years ago, but I am speaking in the legal
sense&mdash;and you reach years of discretion. I think you
did <i>that</i> also a few years since; I&rsquo;m quite sure you did.
However, speaking by the text, you&rsquo;re a man to-morrow,
and can do as you like. You&rsquo;ve done pretty much as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
liked, you dear rascal, for some considerable time, but I
love you the better for that. For the future I have no
hold over you in any sense but that of the affection which
links us, and I think that is a strong tie. For the rest,
you have a right to go your own way. I have brought
you up to no profession, for reasons which I have explained
before; you have a smattering of several languages,
and you know more of the world, I think, and
have certainly seen more of it, than most men of twice
your age. And I think that you&rsquo;ve had rather a good
time during the past five years, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a good time,&rdquo; replied Comethup, &ldquo;that it all
seems to have gone by like a beautiful dream. When I
was a little chap I remember the captain used to tell me
about all the wonderful places there were on the earth,
but I never thought that I should see them. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be
likely to forget that but for you I should be a poor and
shabby fellow, who had never had the chance of putting
his legs outside the little town in which he was born. I
don&rsquo;t forget that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put out her hand to stop him. &ldquo;There, never
mind all that; I&rsquo;ve been repaid a hundredfold. We won&rsquo;t
talk of the past; that&rsquo;s done with. What we have to
consider is the future. Now, you know, Comethup, you&rsquo;re
just a little bit inclined to be extravagant&mdash;don&rsquo;t interrupt
me, and don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m blaming you&mdash;but I
think you are extravagant, just a <i>little</i> bit. Probably the
fault has been mine because I followed a ridiculous practice
of giving you large sums of money just whenever it
occurred to me that you wanted them. Of course, you
were only a boy, and the temptation to spend was a
natural one. Now I think we&rsquo;ll follow a different plan.
I want you to be quite free and independent; I want you
to have money actually of your own, that you may use
for your own purposes. Therefore I&rsquo;ve decided to put a
sum in the bank for you, and to give you your own cheque
book, and let you look after your own affairs. I trust you
so completely that I think it is quite the best thing to
do. You know, or you ought to know by this time, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
I&rsquo;m a very rich woman, and some day you&rsquo;ll have means.
Live your own life and please yourself, and you&rsquo;ll please
me. Now kiss me and say good-night; you&rsquo;ll wake up a
man in the morning. Prince Charming goes upstairs for
the last time to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put his arm about her and kissed her gently.
&ldquo;Not for the last time, dear aunt,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the years
have not changed me so much as that, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put up her hand and softly patted the hand that
lay on her shoulder. &ldquo;No, no; God knows they have not!
You&rsquo;re a good fellow, Comethup; and, if I&rsquo;m not in the
way, I think I want to live a few more years yet, old
though I am, to find out whether you verify all my hopes
of you. Good-night; sleep well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day Comethup entered into possession of all
his new dignities: interviewed the manager at his aunt&rsquo;s
bank, and was solemnly congratulated by that gentleman;
cashed his first cheque, and felt somehow that the coins
were different from any that had jingled in his pockets before.
It was good, too, to feel that perfect new sense of
freedom which the mere turn of a day had given him;
to breathe that larger air of manhood which he felt was
his to have and to hold. There was quite a large dinner
party that evening, for it was necessary, in his aunt&rsquo;s
opinion, that he should be shown, now that he had reached
manhood&rsquo;s estate, just as he had been shown when he first
came into her life.</p>

<p>A few days after, he timidly informed his aunt one
morning that he should like to visit the captain. &ldquo;You
know it&rsquo;s years since I have seen him, and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said his aunt, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re breaking
through our compact. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you you were to go
where you liked, and when you liked, and do what you
liked? Go and see the captain, by all means. But I
think I&rsquo;d write to him first; the sight of you&mdash;giant that
you are&mdash;would be too great a shock to him if you swept
down on him unexpectedly. Write to-day and go to-morrow;
never hesitate about these matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup, in his impatience, sent a telegram instead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
and started off early the next morning, feeling more than
ever the sense of that glorious freedom which had come
into his life. He had merely informed the captain that
he should arrive in the morning, and had not mentioned
the train. Finding, when half his journey was completed,
that he would have to wait some considerable time at an
out-of-the-way station before catching a train which
would take him to his native place, he went on, as he had
done before, to Deal, and there ordered a carriage and
went the rest of the way by road.</p>

<p>It was a delightful feeling to lounge back in the carriage,
on a perfect summer day, with all the country
spread in its glory about him, and to know that this life&mdash;so
rich and full and splendid, so surrounded with every
luxury and care and forethought&mdash;was to go on and on,
through all the years, with no pain or sorrow, with nothing
left to hope for beyond what he had secured. His
wanderings abroad had already taught him the width and
wonder of the world, the pleasant places that were in it,
the happy people who laugh along its sunlit ways. Altogether
it was a bright and healthy and hopeful prospect
that stretched before him, and it was a bright and healthy
and hopeful youngster who looked upon the prospect.</p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s cottage stood among its roses as of
old; seemed only a little smaller even than on the last
occasion&mdash;a little more as though it had sunk gently
down, like a tired old man, and was unable to hold itself
quite so erect as before. Comethup walked up the path
and stood for a moment in the open doorway of the cottage,
and there was the captain.</p>

<p>He was standing in the middle of the little room, and
he looked at the young man for a long moment in silence;
then, on an impulse, each took a step forward and they
clasped hands. Comethup noticed that the captain, like
the house, had sunk a little, that his shoulders were bowed
ever so slightly, and that his hands seemed thinner. But
the touch of the hand was as warm and firm as ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s such a delight
to see you! I suppose the years seem longer when one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
growing old; they would have seemed longer still but for
your letters. It&rsquo;s good of you to have remembered an
old man, and to have come down to see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have come before, only I couldn&rsquo;t very well get
away,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as good to me to be
back in the old place again; no other place seems really
like home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain gave his hands a parting squeeze and let
them go. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said, in a more ordinary tone,
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be content with your old room here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Comethup, laughing. &ldquo;Why not?
You wouldn&rsquo;t have me go to the inn, would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>The portmanteau was brought in and the carriage dismissed.
Lunch was laid in the old simple fashion by
Homer, with whom Comethup warmly shook hands; and
the young man chatted ceaselessly throughout the meal.
There were many things about which the captain was
curious&mdash;things which he had forgotten to mention in his
short letters: as to the standing and apparent strength
of foreign armies, and their methods of life and discipline.
He nodded with supreme satisfaction on being
told that some of the foreign soldiers Comethup had seen
were very small and insignificant and very youthful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as it should be,&rdquo; replied the old man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
very evident that in these things the foreigner is absolutely
incapable of improving himself. He may cook well,
and he may know how to swing off his hat and make a
bow which is much too elaborate to have anything of sincerity
in it, but he can&rsquo;t breed fighting men; the thing is
simply not to be done. I&rsquo;m glad to hear you bear out the
impression I have so long had concerning that matter.
Now that one is&mdash;well, is not quite so strong as in more
lusty years; now that one finds the years creeping on,
it is easier to sleep calmly in one&rsquo;s bed when one knows
that foreign legions&mdash;taken in the lump&mdash;are as you describe
them. Oh, we must never forget, as I have before
pointed out to you, my dear Comethup, that we lie remarkably
near the coast. You remember all the plans we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
used to make, boy,&rdquo; he added less seriously, &ldquo;when you
were a little chap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember well. I was a very little chap
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. And now you tower above me, and
your voice is deeper, and your laugh stronger, and&mdash;well,
I suppose we must expect changes. And yet there&rsquo;s not
much difference in you, Comethup,&rdquo; he added, looking at
him critically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve the same eyes, the same smile.
And I&rsquo;ll be bound you&rsquo;ve the same heart. Yet it&rsquo;s a long
time since you used to trot by my side and get under my
cloak on wet days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat for some moments in silence, musing over
those old times, and then Comethup said quickly, with a
flush on his face: &ldquo;By the way, sir, I am a selfish brute&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
never even asked how &rsquo;Linda is. You remember
little &rsquo;Linda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain smiled and shook his head. &ldquo;Little
&rsquo;Linda no longer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The years don&rsquo;t fly on with
you, boy, and stand still for every one else. &rsquo;Linda is a
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was almost that when I was here before,&rdquo; replied
Comethup. &ldquo;And does she&mdash;does she still live at
the old house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain nodded gravely. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Her
father&rsquo;s dead, you know; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve mentioned
that in writing to you. He was found dead in bed one
morning. He was a strange man. I only saw him once&mdash;let
me see, you were with me, Comethup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup remembered the occasion on which he had
seen the strong, hard face of Dr. Vernier in the little
circle of light among the books and papers. &ldquo;Yes, the
night you carried &rsquo;Linda home; I remember it well. But
who looks after her now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She lives there, in the care of the woman who has
been her governess so long; you remember that the woman
came there almost immediately after you found &rsquo;Linda in
the garden. She seems devoted to the girl. I think
&rsquo;Linda has a little money, and the house is her own. I expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
you&rsquo;ll see her; she has grown into a very beautiful
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt sure she would do that,&rdquo; said Comethup, and
found himself blushing the next moment at having expressed
such an opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I told you in one of my letters that your
Uncle Robert had left here. Did you see anything of
him or of Brian while you were in London or after you&rsquo;d
gone abroad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once or twice,&rdquo; said Comethup, carelessly. &ldquo;You
know Brian has published some poems; very good they
were, too; some people made an awful fuss about them.
Brian is growing quite famous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it,&rdquo; replied the captain, grimly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
the sort of fellow who would write poems; I&rsquo;m told his
father tried his hand at that sort of thing once or twice.
You know that your uncle ran through every penny he
possessed, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t have very much, did he?&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did, though; his fortune was very little short of
that possessed by your aunt. But he ran through the
lot, married more, and settled down here; and now he&rsquo;s
got through that too. Oh, he&rsquo;s a bright fellow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They found much to talk about all that afternoon;
but though Comethup listened to the captain and delighted
the captain&rsquo;s heart by his close and clear descriptions
of foreign places and foreign peoples, yet, if the
truth must be told, he spoke and listened almost mechanically.
Once or twice, while he talked, the very room
in which he sat, and the quiet figure of the captain,
seemed to vanish completely, and in their places was a
dark and lonely garden, filled with the dead leaves of a
year before, and seeming in its desolation the very haunt
of every cheerless wind that blew nowhere else, and in
the garden the figure of a child. Heaven knows through
how many places he had carried that remembrance, in
how many hours he had seen himself, a little child again,
creeping tremblingly into the garden in search for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
ghost. The later remembrance of the girl, as he had
seen her when he left school, seemed to have vanished; it
was, in any case, far more hazy when he tried to think
of it than that earlier vision. Coming back after his
wanderings to the old town had only made the recollection
a stronger one. All the intervening years seemed to
be swept aside, and his heart was melted with pity for the
lonely child.</p>

<p>Yet, strangely enough, the knowledge&mdash;forced upon
him in spite of his dreams&mdash;that she was a woman made
him hesitate to speak of her to the captain; still less to
go and see her, as he might have done years before. So
he let the afternoon wear away, and the dusk of evening
was creeping over the town before he finally announced,
with what carelessness he could summon, that he thought
he would take a walk. The captain must have looked a
little below the carelessness, for, with a fine tact, for
which he can not be sufficiently praised, he suggested that
he felt tired, and would sit by the window and smoke.</p>

<p>Coming to the entrance of the old garden, Comethup
noticed that nothing seemed changed. The gate, which
had long ago fallen, was hidden a little more deeply in
the grasses and weeds, but for the rest it might have been
an enchanted castle, over which a spell had been thrown
and upon which the sunlight must never shine. Even on
that warm summer evening the place struck a chill upon
him as he picked his way across the fallen gate and went
up the avenue. But here at last, as he reached the house,
there was a change. Lights gleamed from a window which
he always remembered to have seen shuttered; and presently,
as he stood, scarcely knowing whether to go up
to the house or indeed what to do, one of the long windows
which opened on to a narrow balcony was pushed
open and a figure came through and stood, clearly outlined
against the light behind, above him.</p>

<p>He knew in a moment that it must be &rsquo;Linda, although
her face was in shadow. He made a half-movement toward
her, and she started forward and came to the edge
of the balcony and leaned over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s down there?&rdquo; she called in a voice scarcely
above a whisper.</p>

<p>He went forward a little, so that the light from the
room behind her might fall upon his face; she peered
down at him anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She did not reply, but turned and moved quickly to
the end of the balcony and ran lightly down a little
flight of iron steps which led to the ground. She came
toward him, still without speaking, and with her hands
clasped. Coming quite close, she looked into his face.
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Comethup!&rdquo; she said, and let her hands fall
to her side.</p>

<p>There was something in the tone in which she spoke
which chilled Comethup almost as much as the desolation
of the place had done a few minutes before; and yet he
could scarcely have said what it was that chilled him.
There seemed, in her words and in her change of attitude,
some disappointment; she might almost have been expecting
to find another in the garden, and to have been unable
altogether to conceal her regret at finding her hope
unfulfilled. But, even while that thought was leaping
through his mind, she had changed again, and was smiling
into his face and clasping his hand, so that he almost
felt that he had been mistaken and had misjudged her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how glad I am to see you!&rdquo; she said quite naturally.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard from the captain about you often;
you know he&rsquo;s never tired of talking of you. And you
know we haven&rsquo;t really met&mdash;you and I&mdash;since we were
children, for when you came here five years ago we only
saw each other for a day or two, and I scarcely remember
what you were like, or what we said to each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the thought I have of you,&rdquo; said Comethup.
&ldquo;I seem to have known, somehow, just what you
would look like as a woman; but it&rsquo;s the little ghost in the
garden&mdash;this garden&mdash;I remember best. Do you remember
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed to shudder a little as she looked about her.
&ldquo;Ah, the ghost!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes, I remember that; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
remember how you came into the garden to find me.
What a frightened baby I was then, to be sure&mdash;what a
frightened, desolate baby!&rdquo; She linked her hand in his
arm and drew him with her along the path in between
the trees. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;walk with me here, as
you did when we were little mites. Oh, it&rsquo;s good to see
you again; it&rsquo;s good to look upon the face of a friend.&rdquo;
Something in her tones struck him to the quick; she
seemed almost on the verge of tears. &ldquo;Have you no
friends, then?&rdquo; he asked gently.</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a faint smile. &ldquo;Well, the
captain&mdash;and&mdash;and Mrs. Dawson&mdash;my governess, you
know. I think that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;ve been all over the world,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she added suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite all of it,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but a great deal.
It makes me feel&mdash;well, like a blackguard, when I think
that you&rsquo;ve been here in this dull house all this time&mdash;five
years, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;while I&rsquo;ve been running about and
having a good time. It doesn&rsquo;t seem fair, does it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked round at him again with a smile. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
nice of you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But, you know, we can&rsquo;t all
have the good things in this world&mdash;can we? Still, I
must confess it&rsquo;s been rather dull; one sees the same
houses and the same faces, and one does the same things
day after day, summer and winter, for years. I&rsquo;m only
glad to take things as they come, and not to think. But
I think sometimes&mdash;of course, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather
be desperately unhappy with some real sorrow than just
exist like this. If one had a real sorrow one could fight
it and live it down and do all sorts of things; but here&rdquo;&mdash;she
made a little despairing gesture with her hand&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s
simply nothing to fight, nothing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreadfully sorry,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;You
know,&rdquo; he added lamely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting to come and
see you, wanting to know something about you, for a
long time; only we&rsquo;ve never been anywhere near England.
But now I shall be able to see a great deal of you,
I hope; I shall be coming down often to&mdash;to see the
captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>Her eyes flashed at him for a moment and then were
turned away. &ldquo;Yes, to see the captain,&rdquo; she responded.</p>

<p>Some one appeared on the little balcony, and a voice
summoned the girl. &rsquo;Linda drew Comethup toward the
house; at the foot of the steps leading to the balcony she
turned toward him. &ldquo;I should be grateful if you would
come in, just for a little while. There&rsquo;s only Mrs.
Dawson there, and she&rsquo;s sure to remember you.&rdquo; She
spoke almost in a tone of humility; her eyes entreated
him.</p>

<p>He followed her up the steps and into the room. The
woman of whom she had spoken was standing a little way
from the window, and looked at him keenly for a moment
as he passed in. &rsquo;Linda stopped and laughingly called
Comethup to her remembrance, and the woman gave him
her hand&mdash;a little distrustfully, he thought. The room
was very meanly furnished, and a lamp stood on a table,
with a work-basket&mdash;with half its contents tumbled out&mdash;beside
the lamp. Mrs. Dawson sat down and took up
some work and began to ply her needle industriously.
&rsquo;Linda drew a chair to the open window and signed to
Comethup to sit near her.</p>

<p>They talked in low tones of many things, she questioning
him eagerly about his travels and the places he
had seen, nodding with quick sympathy when he described
some scene which had caught his fancy, and interposing
a little sigh sometimes as she glanced about the room
or across to the silent figure sewing. &ldquo;Here has been
my world,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;this and the garden; yet I
have dreamed some dreams here too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were silent for some time, and Comethup,
glancing up, suddenly met the keen glance of Mrs. Dawson.
She dropped her eyes in a moment, but he had an
uneasy feeling afterward that she constantly watched
him. She went from the room a few moments before he
took his departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When shall I see you again?&rdquo; he asked as he held
the girl&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re staying with the captain? Well, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
shall be there every day, I&rsquo;ve no doubt; you&rsquo;ll see far too
much of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughingly assured her that that was impossible,
ran down the steps and waved his hand to her where
she stood leaning over the balcony, and went rapidly down
the avenue. To reach the gate he had to take a sharp
turn, which drew him out of sight of the house; when
within a few yards of it a woman&rsquo;s figure came swiftly
from among the trees, and Mrs. Dawson, bareheaded and
white-faced, confronted him.</p>

<p>He was on the point of holding out his hand and
bidding her good-night, when he saw that she had come
there of set and serious purpose; she was actually trembling
in her eagerness to speak. He looked at her in
some astonishment, not knowing what to say or do; she
stood resolutely between him and the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you come here like a thief, to whisper with
her in the darkness?&rdquo; she asked. Her voice was suppressed
and she glanced uneasily in the direction of the
house, as though fearful of being overheard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t come like a thief,&rdquo; said Comethup indignantly.
&ldquo;Why, I came here to-night for the first time
for five years, just to see her, and she saw me from the
balcony and came down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first time for five years! Why do you lie to me?
There are things I can&rsquo;t tell you, but my eyes are keener
for her, my hearing stronger, all my senses more alive,
than for any one else. That&rsquo;s because&mdash;because I love her.
Why do you lie to me? Do you think I haven&rsquo;t seen you
creep into the garden and call softly to her and whisper
with her in the shadows, and then creep away again&mdash;yes,
like a thief, I say? I&rsquo;ve seen her sit by that window night
after night listening to catch the faintest sound; I&rsquo;ve seen
the light in her eyes after you&rsquo;ve left her. Tell me&mdash;in
God&rsquo;s name, tell me!&mdash;what would you do with her?&rdquo; She
came at him fiercely, with her hands held straight at her
sides and clinched, and with her head thrust forward at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mrs. Dawson,&rdquo; said Comethup helplessly,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re making some horrible mistake. I swear to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
I haven&rsquo;t set foot in this town for five years; I&rsquo;ve been
travelling all over Europe. I came down by the train
from London this morning, and walked round here to
see her to-night. You&rsquo;re making a mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came still nearer to him and looked into his eyes;
perhaps she read the truth there. She looked at him in
perplexity for a moment, and then, muttering something
to herself, turned swiftly and began to make her way back
to the house. But Comethup sprang after her and caught
her arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t go like that. There&rsquo;s
something here I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tried to free herself from his grasp. &ldquo;Oh, it
doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&mdash;I suppose I have made a mistake,&rdquo;
she said uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it <i>does</i> matter,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;You say that
some one meets &rsquo;Linda; oh, you must have been making
a mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not tell her?&rdquo; asked the woman eagerly.
&ldquo;She would be angry with me; she would not understand.
You will not tell her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course I won&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; said Comethup
doubtfully, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m quite sure you&rsquo;ve made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dawson, and set off at a rapid
pace for the house.</p>

<p>Comethup, walking home under the stars, remembered
that &rsquo;Linda had seemed, when first he saw her that night,
to be expecting some one else. He linked that remembrance
and the words he had just heard together, and was
troubled.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="subheading">AUNT CHARLOTTE IS SYMPATHETIC.</p>


<p>Comethup almost forgot his distrust and his fears during
the few days which followed, for &rsquo;Linda came to
the captain&rsquo;s cottage in quite the old fashion and accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
them on their excursions, and seemed, in heart
and soul, but little removed from the child of old times.
She danced and flitted as gaily as ever among the roses,
and was in all things so tenderly, earnestly grateful to
Comethup for the excursions he planned and the holidays
he gave her that he was more than rewarded, and began
to find that no day was quite complete in which he did
not see her, no night a time of serene and happy dreams
in which he did not carry to his pillow some tender word
she had spoken, or the remembrance of some glance she had
given him. In that growing love for her which filled him
he began&mdash;as lovers will&mdash;to read into her words, even of
the most commonplace order, a new meaning; to give
them a new gentleness, as addressed to himself. He was
in danger of forgetting his duties in London altogether
had not the captain delicately reminded him of his aunt
one morning while they sat at breakfast. Comethup
flushed with contrition, and determined to go to town
at once.</p>

<p>He promised &rsquo;Linda on taking leave of her that he
would come down again soon, and he kept his word. To
such effect did he keep it that Miss Charlotte Carlaw,
regarding his absences from London with some anxiety,
touched at last upon the matter in her own characteristic
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather fond of the captain, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
said to him one day, when he had carelessly suggested
to her that he thought he would run down to see the
old man on the morrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Comethup slowly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always been&mdash;been
very good friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I should imagine,&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw, with a short
laugh. &ldquo;Are you aware, my dear boy, that you&rsquo;ve been
down to see the captain five times in about seven weeks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think it was quite so many as that,&rdquo; said
Comethup. He felt grateful that his aunt could not see
his face. &ldquo;But you see&mdash;well, the captain&rsquo;s always glad
to see me&mdash;and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I perfectly understand, Comethup. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
look here, boy, I&rsquo;m an old woman and I&rsquo;ve had a good
deal to do with men and women, young and old. Boy,
you&rsquo;re keeping something from me, and it isn&rsquo;t fair; I
thought we were too good comrades for that. Come, I
don&rsquo;t want you to tell me anything that you&rsquo;d rather keep
to yourself, but you won&rsquo;t humbug me into believing that
you fly down to that sleepy hollow whenever you can find
time for the sake of seeing the captain. Now, then, is she
dark or fair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup hesitated for a moment, then laughingly
said, &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t know the difference between one
and the other,&rdquo; pursued Miss Carlaw. &ldquo;I only know that
it makes a difference in the character. Well, I suppose
you&rsquo;ve sworn eternal vows, and have fully made up your
minds&mdash;both of you&mdash;to die at once if anything should
separate you, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite that,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;In fact, I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;haven&rsquo;t
really said anything to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me that you&rsquo;ve been
rushing backward and forward all this time and are just
where you were when you started? Lord! things were
different in my time. I must say you&rsquo;ve been devilish
slow, Comethup. Well, tell me all about it. Of course
I know she&rsquo;s beautiful; we&rsquo;ll take that for granted. But
is she nice? Is she a lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s everything that&rsquo;s nice, and of course she&rsquo;s a
lady,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;You remember when I was
quite a little fellow and you brought me to London? Do
you remember also that I mentioned a child of whom I
was very fond&mdash;&rsquo;Linda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Carlaw nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I remember very well.
And I suppose she&rsquo;s grown up, and has wrought havoc with
your young affections all over again? Well, you&rsquo;re just
the sort of fellow to fall in love very desperately and be
tremendously in earnest. I&rsquo;m sure I wish you luck. Only
don&rsquo;t break your heart if you lose; there isn&rsquo;t a woman in
the world that a man need break his heart over; you&rsquo;ll
find that out some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! but she&rsquo;s different from all other women; there
couldn&rsquo;t be anybody like her,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly; we take that for granted. Most women are
stamped by some man or other at some moment of their
lives with that hall-mark which sets them above every
one of their sisters; the ugliest and the commonest of
them may claim that privilege, in most cases at least, if
only for an hour or two. But what about this girl? Does
she know anything about you? Does she know you&rsquo;re
rich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Comethup a little indignantly.
&ldquo;But it wouldn&rsquo;t make any difference to her
if she knew it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not; how should it?&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw
dryly. &ldquo;Riches never make any difference in this world,
do they, my dreamer? There, I won&rsquo;t laugh at you; go
on with your wooing, and prosper in it. Do her parents,
or whoever looks after her, know anything about the
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has no parents,&rdquo; said Comethup; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re dead,
both of them.&rdquo; And forthwith he proceeded to give his
aunt some account of &rsquo;Linda and her history, so far as
he knew; of how he had first found her, and her friendship
for the captain, with many details of her loveliness
and her charm which must have wearied the excellent old
lady very much. However, she expressed deep interest
in the matter, and listened with the utmost attention.
Presently she got up from her chair and began to walk
up and down the room, with her hand on his arm, in
silence. After some minutes she broke the silence and
spoke almost as though she were alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s the one thing worth having, the one thing
worth holding&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure that it isn&rsquo;t the one thing
worth dying for. Ah! that sounds foolish, perhaps, from
the lips of an old woman to whom God never gave anything
to attract a man&mdash;except perhaps a sharp tongue,
and that sometimes drives &rsquo;em away. But you mustn&rsquo;t
think, Comethup, that you&rsquo;re the only one on this earth
that&rsquo;s ever been in love. I know you think that no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
ever had it quite so badly as you&rsquo;ve got it; that all the
others have been quite ordinary affairs compared to
yours. But the best and the worst of us, the lowest and
the highest, may all chance to have a touch of that fever
in their passage from the cradle to the grave. It&rsquo;s a
beautiful fever, and I think the delirium of it takes us
precious near heaven.&ldquo;</p>

<p>She stopped again for some moments and appeared
very thoughtful; finally shook her head, laughed a little,
sighed, and squeezed his arm more tightly.</p>

<p>&rdquo;<i>I</i> had it once&mdash;that fever; I had it very badly. No
one ever knew it, thank Heaven! I speak of it now for
the first time, yet I would not willingly forget it. What
a long, long time ago it seems! What a mad business it
was&mdash;and ye gods! what I suffered! I can afford to
laugh at it now, boy; but it wasn&rsquo;t a laughing matter
then, I can assure you. It was just that sort of crazy
business that a man or a woman drifts into without knowing
it, and then wakes up suddenly, with a start, to a
new life, as it were. I&mdash;poor fool that I was&mdash;fell in
love with a man&rsquo;s voice&mdash;the sweetest voice and the most
honest, I think, I&rsquo;ve ever heard. He liked to talk to me;
was good enough sometimes, when I was lonely and out
of sorts, to come and read to me. Lord! the music of
it all is in my ears now. A woman grows more lovely&mdash;even
if she be plain she grows quite passable&mdash;but
she grows more lovely in her own estimation just in
proportion as a man seems to think her lovely, or
seems to rate her above other women. I thought that&mdash;and
had my awakening. He came to me one day
and took my hand&mdash;God! what brutes men can be without
knowing it!&mdash;and said he knew that I was his friend,
and he wanted me to help him. He was in love with
some one else; opposition had been placed in his way,
and I, curiously enough, had influence. He wanted me
to help him. Well, I did. I saw them married. I
made a speech&mdash;a damned ridiculous speech&mdash;at their
wedding, and sent everybody into fits of laughter. And
all the time my heart was aching as I never thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
anybody&rsquo;s heart could ache. So you see I know what it
is, Comethup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paced about for some time longer and then sat
down and resumed her natural manner. Comethup, who
had been on the point of offering some sort of consolation,
was so disarmed by the ease with which she threw aside
any touch of emotion she had displayed that he said
nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, boy, I want you to be happy; I&rsquo;m quite sure
you deserve to be. And I don&rsquo;t know the girl who could
help falling in love with you if you set about it in the
right way. But do your wooing in your own fashion; I
don&rsquo;t want to interfere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup paid another visit to the captain on the
following day, announcing his coming by telegraph about
an hour or so before he actually arrived. The worthy
captain was, of course, delighted to see him, although
probably he had his own suspicions concerning the real
object of the visit. The young man, emboldened by his
conversation with his aunt, and filled with a desperate
longing to see &rsquo;Linda, left the captain soon after dinner
and set off to find her. The captain seemed to understand
the matter perfectly, and when Comethup would
have offered some excuse for his departure merely clapped
him on the shoulder and gently thrust him out of the
house.</p>

<p>It was a clear and calm autumn evening, with just
that faintest chill in the air which seemed to whisper of
a coming winter&mdash;a chill so slight that it only quickened
the blood, made the air seem purer, and caused one unconsciously
to quicken one&rsquo;s step. As Comethup went
along the road which led to the old garden, the sun was
setting out beyond the wastes of land behind the town,
and the old-fashioned red roofs and the square tower of
the Norman church were bathed in the warm light, and
all their edges softened by it. He thought he had never
seen the old place looking so peaceful before.</p>

<p>As he reached the gates he saw, with a sudden leaping
of his pulses, that &rsquo;Linda was standing against the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
which still hung on its hinges, and was looking out into
the road. She sprang forward with a little cry of pleasure
as he came near her, and took his hand and drew him
quickly into the garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not hope to see you so soon again,&rdquo; she said
softly, looking up at him. &ldquo;When did you arrive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; said Comethup, holding her hand in both
his own and looking into her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only to-day? And you came at once to see me.
That was good of you. So many other people would not
have troubled, or would have waited until to-morrow.
But you came at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a new tenderness in her voice, a new light
in her eyes&mdash;or so he thought&mdash;that was not born of mere
gratitude. She almost seemed, with her warm fingers
twined about his, to be clinging to him; he thought with
regret of the desperate loneliness that must have been
hers, through the days since last he had seen her; of the
weary evenings through which, perhaps, she had stood at
the gate, looking out along the road while he was far
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not have waited until to-morrow,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should have slept. &rsquo;Linda, you don&rsquo;t
know how much, how tremendously I wanted to see you.
Dear, I always want to see you more than any one else
in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent, looking up at him and smiling gravely
into his face. The trees about them seemed almost to
have hushed their whispering and their rustling, to hear
what the two had to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; he went on almost in a whisper,
&ldquo;how I found you here first, and how you&mdash;you kissed
me when I left you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head and laughed. &ldquo;No, I surely didn&rsquo;t
do that. And if I did&mdash;well, we were very young&mdash;mere
babies, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Linda, don&rsquo;t laugh at me. We&rsquo;re not children any
longer; but I&rsquo;ve never ceased to think of you, never
ceased to&mdash;to love you. I think&mdash;in fact, I know&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
I came here to-night to tell you that; I think I&rsquo;ve tried&mdash;tried
very hard&mdash;to tell you several times before. Only
I was afraid that you wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lifted the hands she held and laid them for a
moment against her cheek, then looked up at him. &ldquo;Why
should I not listen?&rdquo; she asked gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, because I didn&rsquo;t think it was possible that you
would care anything for me. You see I&rsquo;m only a big,
rough fellow; I&rsquo;m not even clever, or anything of that
kind, but I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She slipped one hand from his grasp and laid it quickly
on his lips. &ldquo;Hush! you are the best fellow in the
world,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve always seemed to turn
to you and think of you most naturally when I wanted
help or consolation; in the dullest and the weariest hours
I think you&rsquo;ve seemed to smile at me and make me
stronger. Oh, are you sure you love me?&rdquo; She laid the
hand that had touched his lips upon his shoulder and
looked up into his eyes; her lips were quivering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure; I love you with all
my heart and soul. I know I&rsquo;m young, but I&rsquo;ve never
seemed to think about anybody else; there has never been
any one else. It&rsquo;s always been little &rsquo;Linda in the garden;
I&rsquo;ve always felt your arms about my neck, just as
you put them when we were children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She slipped them round his neck now. &ldquo;See, they
are there again,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;But, oh, are you sure,
<i>quite</i> sure, that you will never change; that you will love
me always?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; he replied simply. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t change.&rdquo;
He bent his head and kissed her; and she clung to him,
sighing a little and glancing behind her at the shadows
among the trees. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re frightened, dear,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not frightened. Only this place weighs upon
me a little, and the years have seemed so long while I
have been waiting. How good you are to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to be, dear love,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring such
sunshine into your life, it shall be such a time of happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
holidays that you shall forget all the weariness, all the
waiting; I&rsquo;ll make you forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, looking round the garden again, &ldquo;yes,
I&rsquo;ll try to forget it&mdash;hark! what was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew away from him suddenly and stood with
her hands clasped on her breast, looking toward the gate
they had left. A faint light shone beyond it in the road,
but all was still and quiet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear nothing,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>She stood listening for a moment, and then laughed
and came back to him. &ldquo;I thought I heard some one
come into the garden,&rdquo; she said with a smile. &ldquo;But it
was only fancy. When one has wandered long in a desolate
place like this, and has had no companion but one&rsquo;s
own thoughts, one is full of fears and fancies.&rdquo; She
threw her arms suddenly about him, and hid her face
upon his breast. &ldquo;Take me away soon, dear,&rdquo; she whispered;
&ldquo;let me forget everything. You don&rsquo;t know,
can&rsquo;t guess, how bitterly, bitterly tired I am of it
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He soothed her with gentle words, and presently led
her toward the house. Beneath the little balcony she
stopped and put her hands upon his breast and thrust
him gently away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I am very tired,
and shall go straight to my room. I&rsquo;ll see you to-morrow,
and many other to-morrows,&rdquo; she added, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, dear love,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Do you remember
the night I came here first, after my return, and
saw you on the balcony up there, and you ran down
to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I remember. Good-night!&rdquo;
She kissed him swiftly and slipped out of his arms and
ran up the steps, paused on the balcony for a moment to
blow a kiss to him, and was gone.</p>

<p>He lingered about the garden quite a long time, until
the lights had disappeared one by one and the house
stood up black against the sky. Then, carrying his hat
in his hand, as though the very place in which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
walked were hallowed, he went out of the garden and
back to the captain.</p>

<p>He found that gentleman conning a newspaper in his
little parlour with the aid of a reading glass. The captain
scorned spectacles, although they were really necessary
in his case; he considered them effeminate. A reading
glass was a graceful compromise. He looked up as
Comethup entered, and laid down the glass and carefully
folded the paper. &ldquo;Well, boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose you
found her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Comethup, &ldquo;I found her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in his tone, in the large-hearted joyousness
of it, struck the captain; he got up and stood with
one hand resting on the table, looking across the shaded
lamp at Comethup, who towered hugely at the other
side of the room. For a moment or two nothing was said;
then the captain made the half-circuit of the table, and
they looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes and their hands met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the captain.</p>

<p>Comethup nodded and beamed upon him. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s going to be my wife. I&rsquo;ve loved her&mdash;oh,
a long time&mdash;ever since I was a little chap. Isn&rsquo;t it
splendid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain gave Comethup&rsquo;s hand a final grip and
let it go. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the best woman in the world,&rdquo; he said
with great emphasis, and went back to his chair.</p>

<p>In the few days that followed before Comethup returned
to London the captain endeavoured to frame
various excuses for keeping out of the young people&rsquo;s
way. To-day he would be too tired; on another occasion
there would be letters to write, or something which needed
immediate attention in the garden. But Comethup and
the girl laughingly insisted on his accompanying them,
declaring that they could not possibly expect to be thoroughly
happy if they left him at home. So, with some
misgivings, he continued to be their companion as of old.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Linda proved on that nearer, more delightfully intimate
acquaintanceship with her to be the strangest
creature of moods and caprices that could well be imagined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
There seemed always a passionate desire in her
heart to be all, in tenderness and gentleness, that her
lover could wish; to show him how deep and sincere her
love and gratitude were. Yet, though she succeeded in
part in that desire, there were hours when she showed
him only petulance; when the beautiful face was turned
to him almost with careless indifference to meet his
caress; when the words he uttered seemed to fall on unheeding
ears. Again and again he left her at night with
the miserable feeling that he had failed in some way to
please her; blaming himself always, in that he was a
rough and uncouth fellow, and that her delicacy and
sweetness were things he could not properly meet.</p>

<p>She was always filled with the deepest contrition afterward;
was always a thousand times kinder and gentler
to him than she had been before, so that the misery he
had suffered was more than atoned for. On one memorable
occasion, when nothing that he did or said seemed
to please her all day, and when she had scarcely responded
to his caress when they parted under the balcony, she
came running after him while he was sadly walking down
the avenue, and cried his name, caught his arm, and fell
breathless upon his breast, weeping. He feared that
something had occurred to startle her, and was beginning
eagerly and anxiously to question her, when she stopped
him and poured out all that was in her self-accusing heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, my love, don&rsquo;t go from me like this!
Why are you always so kind and good and gentle to me?
Why don&rsquo;t you strike me, or laugh at me, or call me harsh
names&mdash;anything that should teach me how bad I am
and how shamefully I treat you? Dear heart, I&rsquo;ve been
horrid to you all day&mdash;won&rsquo;t you tell me that I&rsquo;ve been
horrid?&rdquo; She looked up into his face and gently shook
him.</p>

<p>He looked down at her, held her close, and laughed
happily. &ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you that,&rdquo; he said slowly,
&ldquo;because it wouldn&rsquo;t be true, &rsquo;Linda dear. We can&rsquo;t always
be alike, you know, and if the world doesn&rsquo;t go
right with you sometimes&mdash;well, I suppose that isn&rsquo;t your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
fault. You&rsquo;re always a great deal too good to me, much
more than I deserve, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have you different
for all the world. Whether you&rsquo;re glad or sorry, or
whether you say the sweetest things to me to tease me,
you&rsquo;re just &rsquo;Linda, and that&rsquo;s all I want. You mustn&rsquo;t
fret, dear; you&rsquo;ve done nothing that I should call you
harsh names for; there&rsquo;s nothing you could do&mdash;now or
at any time&mdash;that could possibly be wrong. Don&rsquo;t you
understand that? It&rsquo;s just because I love you, and think
there&rsquo;s no one like you in the world, that I think everything
you do is right. I don&rsquo;t seem to be able to say exactly
what&rsquo;s in my heart, but I think you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you knew sometimes how miserable I feel after
I&rsquo;ve behaved badly to you&mdash;how I cry myself to sleep
sometimes, thinking about it&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t think so
badly of me,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my darling, I don&rsquo;t think badly of you. Don&rsquo;t
I tell you that everything you do is right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you will only always think that; if you will
be content with me just as I am; if you will remember
only all my good days and forget all the bad ones!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are no bad days,&rdquo; he replied generously.
&ldquo;Indeed, I have nothing to forgive or to forget. How
could I have? Why, it just shows what a wonderful little
woman you are, that you could run out here again to-night
and say all this to me just because you thought
that you&rsquo;d been unkind to me. And you hadn&rsquo;t been
unkind at all. There, good-night, and don&rsquo;t cry yourself
to sleep, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They parted happily enough, and he watched her as
she ran back to the house. Turning slowly at last, with
lingering feet he passed out of the garden. As he
reached the road a man brushed close against him and
glanced up sharply into his face in the darkness, then
passed on. Comethup, with a muttered word of apology,
went his way.</p>

<p>In a few moments, however, he had an uncomfortable
sensation that the man was following him&mdash;keeping well
out of sight in the shadows of doorways, but still doggedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
following. The young man stopped once or twice, and
the man immediately stopped too and disappeared; when
Comethup went on again the man&rsquo;s step could be distinctly
heard behind. At last, with a growing feeling of
anger, Comethup swung round and quickly retraced his
steps; the movement was so sudden that the man was
taken by surprise and stopped falteringly, evidently not
quite knowing what to do. He was an old man, much
bent about the shoulders&mdash;apparently not from age, but
rather as a result of heavy labour of some kind.</p>

<p>Comethup stared at him for a moment, and then,
as the man glanced up again at him and made a movement
to get past him, Comethup knew him; it was old
Medmer Theed. His anger died away, and he held out
his hand to the old man. &ldquo;Why, Theed,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t make out who on earth was dodging along behind
me; I had no idea it was you. How are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am well, I thank you,&rdquo; replied the old man a little
distrustfully. &ldquo;You are out late, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we don&rsquo;t call this late in London,&rdquo; said Comethup
with a laugh. &ldquo;Besides, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, you
know why I&rsquo;m out late. Didn&rsquo;t I see you five minutes
ago, as I came out from Miss Vernier&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did,&rdquo; said the old man, chopping his words
off sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just been to see her home, you know,&rdquo; said Comethup.
&ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t see as much of her now&mdash;not
as much as you used to do? Don&rsquo;t you remember
how she used to sit on the bench beside you in your shop
when she was quite a little thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I likely to forget it?&rdquo; asked Theed, looking up
at him out of his bright dark eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I&mdash;a hundred
times a day, when I&rsquo;m at work&mdash;feel her close beside
me? Don&rsquo;t I hear, in the air about me, the very sound of
the childish songs she used to croon to me? Do I remember?&rdquo;
He made a step suddenly toward Comethup,
and laid a hand on his arm. &ldquo;You were but a child then,
a baby like herself; have you forgotten? Can any one
who has ever looked into her eyes forget her? They say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
you have travelled far&mdash;for many years in many lands;
yet her eyes drew you back here again as surely as a load-stone.
Could you resist them? Could you forget her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re quite
right there: I&rsquo;m quite sure no one could forget her who
had once seen her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One and all, young and old, she draws them all
back,&rdquo; went on the old man, speaking as if to himself.
&ldquo;The years go on and bring their changes; the snows
come and the flowers bloom again; and still she calls them
all back, still she draws them to her. I dreamed once that
it might be possible to keep her a child always; to keep
her close beside me, crooning her songs and playing with
her doll, and knowing nothing of anything outside; never
growing older, and never knowing any sorrows but such
as may innocently touch a child. But the dream never
came true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you couldn&rsquo;t expect it to come true,&rdquo; said
Comethup, looking at him wonderingly. &ldquo;&rsquo;Linda was
obliged to grow up, as we all grow; and now she&rsquo;s quite a
beautiful woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a woman&mdash;a beautiful woman,&rdquo; whispered the
old man, passing his hand in a dazed way across his forehead.
&ldquo;There was another child&mdash;or was it this same
child, after all?&mdash;a child who grew to be a woman, and
then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He came eagerly, almost threateningly, toward
Comethup in the deserted street and looked up scowlingly
at him. &ldquo;Why do you come here at all? Why not leave
her in peace? Why not leave her a child&mdash;in heart at
least? The world is wide, and you have seen much of it;
this is but a little corner of it, a place hidden away. Why
not go out into your world and leave her in peace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup looked at him in amazement for a moment&mdash;amazement
not unmixed with awe, for the man
appeared so desperately in earnest. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo;
he said at last. &ldquo;But since you think of her so
much, and because I know you were her friend when she
was very young, let me tell you that I love her very
dearly, and that she is to be my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your wife! Ah! there was some one else who said
that once. It is such an easy thing to say! Yet you look&mdash;yes,
you seem honest. I remember I liked your face
when you were a child. Will you swear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, if you won&rsquo;t believe my bare word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what will you swear by?&rdquo; He glanced up
at the starlit sky. &ldquo;Not by the stars: there is no firmness
or strength about them; they glitter and shine to-night,
and all the heavens blaze with them; to-morrow
you shall not see one of them. No, there&rsquo;s no constancy
about the stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the moon, then,&rdquo; said Comethup lightly, willing
to humour him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not by the moon; that&rsquo;s lovers&rsquo; nonsense&mdash;they
all swear by that. But there&mdash;you need not swear. I can
read men&rsquo;s faces like a book, and I have read yours.
Only be good to her, be true to her&mdash;for her sake and
your own. For the man who wrongs her&rdquo;&mdash;he shook a
trembling, knotted forefinger in the air&mdash;&ldquo;the man who
wrongs her deals first with me and afterward with his
God. She came to me a mite of a child, sent straight by
God to fill an ache in my heart; came to me with smiling
eyes, just as another baby&mdash;or was it the same?&mdash;I
always forget&mdash;just as another baby once came to me.
She belongs to me, and no man shall harm her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that I shall harm her, do you?&rdquo;
asked Comethup gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, <i>you</i> will not; but others may. I can not rest
for thoughts of her&mdash;dreams of her. I do not know which
are the dreams and which the waking. But I have crept
at night about her house to see that all was well with her;
I have been like a faithful dog, to guard the place where
she sleeps. For that is her power: she draws all to her
who have seen her once. But she draws the good and
the evil alike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muttering to himself he turned abruptly and went
rapidly toward the centre of the town, where his own
dwelling was. Comethup looked after him for a moment,
and then went thoughtfully back to the captain&rsquo;s house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
The captain had gone to bed, but had left a light burning
in the little parlour for Comethup. On the table lay a
packet addressed to him from London. On breaking the
seal he found that the envelope contained two or three
letters which had arrived for him in his absence, and had
been forwarded by Miss Carlaw&rsquo;s housekeeper.</p>

<p>Two of the letters were unimportant, but a third was
from his cousin Brian. He sat down and began to read
it by the light of the lamp. It had been hurriedly
scrawled, and he had some difficulty in deciphering it.
Briefly and jauntily, with a delightful candour which
under other circumstances would have been refreshing
and even amusing, Brian informed his &ldquo;best friend on
earth&rdquo; that he was in desperate straits, and near starvation
point; that he had but one thing on which to congratulate
himself, and that was that he was but treading
in the footsteps of many men more illustrious than he
could hope to be, who had travelled the same stony road
before; but that the consolation demanded a large amount
of philosophy to make it effective when it was remembered
that actual food was not always to be obtained;
that his landlady, who was a hopeless Philistine, refused
to be comforted with promises, or with the possibility
of seeing herself immortalized by reason of her businesslike
connection with her impecunious lodger; that things
were, in a word, at their worst. He implored his cousin
to come to his rescue; this would absolutely be the last
occasion on which such an appeal would be necessary, as
his real prospects, from a sordid point of view, were growing
brighter every day.</p>

<p>Comethup read the letter through carefully, smiling
a little at some of the quaint phrases and sighing a little
over the whole business. It happened that he had decided
to go back to London on the morrow, and he was
glad to think how much easier now it would be to help
his cousin than before he had an income of his own.
Whatever might occur, and whatever he might have to
keep from his aunt, he would at least be spending that
with which he had a right to be doing as he liked. Comforted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
by that thought, he thrust the letter into his
pocket and went to bed.</p>

<p>Brian had given an address in the neighbourhood of
the Euston Road&mdash;in a queer, shabby street of tall houses,
every one of which, Comethup discovered as he traversed
it, appeared eager to share its accommodation with single
gentlemen, or indeed with any one who might care to
apply. Comethup, with a mental picture before him of
his cousin sitting in a cheerless room, with hollow cheeks
and sunken eyes, craving food, had not hesitated a moment
after reaching London, but had driven straight to
Brian&rsquo;s lodging, with his portmanteau on the roof of
the cab. His arrival caused something of a flutter; it was
evident that he was regarded as a prospective lodger.
But when he inquired for Mr. Brian Carlaw, the landlady
herself appeared&mdash;a little thin, eager woman, with an
anxious, watery smile upon her face. A look of relief
seemed to come over her when she saw Comethup. Prosperity&mdash;a
prosperity which was new to her&mdash;seemed to be
about this well-dressed, elegant young man with the grave
eyes. With something of timidity she begged that he
would step for a moment into a room she indicated; she
would like a word with him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="subheading">GENIUS ASSERTS ITSELF.</p>


<p>The landlady followed him with a hesitating air and
stood looking at him for a moment or two without speaking.
Seeing that she trembled and nervously twisted the
edge of a shabby black silk apron between her fingers, he
began to imagine that something must be the matter&mdash;that
something dreadful must have happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Mr. Carlaw is not ill?&rdquo; he exclaimed anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>The landlady shook her head. &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she began,
and her voice was faded and thin and anxious like herself;
&ldquo;he ain&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call ill&mdash;not by no means. Not,
that is to say, in body; but I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;is mind ain&rsquo;t
quite what it ought to be&mdash;not for peacefulness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that,&rdquo; said Comethup gravely.
&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better see him? I think you said he was in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a word I&rsquo;d like to say to you first, sir,&rdquo; she
interrupted hastily. &ldquo;Might I make so bold as to ask if
you&rsquo;re a friend of Mr. Carlaw&rsquo;s, or perhaps a relation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Comethup, &ldquo;I am his cousin. Why do
you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman came a little nearer to him and mysteriously
lowered her voice. &ldquo;Sir, it&rsquo;s now a matter of nine
weeks since Mr. Carlaw first entered this &rsquo;ouse. I won&rsquo;t
deny it, as I was took with &rsquo;im; frank and free was &rsquo;e,
an&rsquo; &rsquo;earty, to the point o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; quite familiar. &rsquo;Is meals
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s &rsquo;ad reg&rsquo;lar, and always a kind word as to the cookin&rsquo;,
and the quality of things in general. And I won&rsquo;t deny,
sir, as we&rsquo;re proud of &rsquo;im. &rsquo;E give me one of &rsquo;is books,
and though I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo;avin&rsquo; &rsquo;ad to work &rsquo;ard all my
days, an&rsquo; po&rsquo;try bein&rsquo; a thing, to my mind, as one must
be eddicated up to&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t make much of it, still there
it was, and the print, I must say, was like the &rsquo;Oly Bible
for clearness. But proud we may be, and proud we may
continue, and I won&rsquo;t deny as &rsquo;e gives the &rsquo;ouse wot one
might call &lsquo;tone&rsquo;; but neither pride nor tone never filled
any one&rsquo;s stomach yet, if you&rsquo;ll forgive me mentionin&rsquo;
such things before a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Comethup slowly, &ldquo;I suppose you
mean my cousin has not&mdash;not been able to keep quite
regular as regards his payments, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reg&rsquo;lar ain&rsquo;t the word, sir, I do assure you. He ain&rsquo;t
paid nothink yet; not even the week in advance as I asks
for in general from all as comes to me. But &rsquo;e were that
smilin&rsquo; and &rsquo;appy and easy with me when &rsquo;e first set foot
in the place, and such a way &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad with &rsquo;im, that it
seemed like a insult to mention such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I understand,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;If,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
without hurting your feelings or&mdash;or disturbing your arrangements
in any way, I might be permitted to be responsible
for this bill, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She burst into tears; not with any violence, but rather
with as near an approach to happiness as the dull routine
of her hard life had left her capable of. She began to
assure him, with a gratitude which was pitiful, that she
saw what he was in his face directly she met him; mentioned,
between her exclamations of relief, the exact sum
to a halfpenny which was then due; and felt her small
horizon cleared of clouds by the appearance of a banknote.
The bill paid and duly receipted, she broke into extravagant
praise of her lodger&mdash;of his manners, of his cleverness,
of his wit. Comethup begged to be taken to him,
and she led the way up the stairs with alacrity, and
ushered him into Brian&rsquo;s room with smiles and ejaculations
of respect which must have given the whole business
away to the most innocent mind.</p>

<p>Brian Carlaw was lying on a sofa near the window,
smoking a cigarette and reading. Books and papers
were strewn in all directions&mdash;flung about, it would almost
appear, with something of studied carelessness. The
whole place was full of the reek of stale tobacco; the
man on the sofa appeared, late though it was, to be but
just out of bed, so carelessly dressed and so generally unkempt
was he. He did not rise, but waved a hand toward
Comethup by way of welcome. The landlady, with murmurs,
had gone out and closed the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear old chap, this is a surprise indeed. Somehow
or other I&rsquo;ve lost sight of you&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t find you
anywhere. In moments of desperation I&rsquo;ve even taken
to hanging about outside that aristocratic town residence;
of yours in the hope of seeing you, but I&rsquo;ve only seen
my afflicted aunt drive out alone. Where have you been,
my young Cr&oelig;sus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been away. Your letter was sent on to me,
and so, as I returned to-day, I came straight here. I&rsquo;m
sorry to hear that things have gone so badly with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, when did they ever go well? I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
brought into this world first with a disposition to sit in
the sunshine and play with flowers; and yet it seems to
me that there&rsquo;s always a howling tempest as a sort of
cheerful music to accompany me on my journey through
life, and a snowstorm thrown in, just for luck. I was
born for fair and pleasant things; I get only hard ones.
I am the plaything of the gods, and the favourite game
of the gods appears to be football. My very landlady
looks at me with an expression which tells me I am little
else than a robber of the widow and the fatherless; my
sensitive soul will not permit me to meet her eye at meal
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d worry about her any more if I
were you,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;I took the liberty, in order
to save you any trouble, of settling up with her. I hope
you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian Carlaw brought his legs down from the sofa, and
sat upright. He shook his head playfully for a moment,
then began to smile, then to laugh outright; finally he
got up and came at Comethup in his pleasantest and most
jovial fashion, and clapped both hands on his shoulders.
&ldquo;You dear old rascal,&rdquo; he said, and his eyes had a light
of tenderness in them which was sufficient repayment, if
any were needed, for anything that Comethup had done;
&ldquo;you dear old rascal, I knew that you&rsquo;d put things right
for me directly you came. You know, old boy, my nature&mdash;damn
it, I can&rsquo;t help it; it was born in me&mdash;my nature
is a proud and a sensitive one; and though I may carry
a brave face to the world, and laugh and joke with these
people who have for the moment to supply me with bread
and butter and a roof to cover me, still my spirit rebels
against the idea of owing them money. I don&rsquo;t like it;
I don&rsquo;t want to feel that I owe this man or that woman,
of however common clay they may be, so many pounds,
shillings, and pence. I&rsquo;ve got my work to think about,
my hopes in life to realize; and these sordid things come
up against me and hurt me, and leave their stain, as it
were, upon the work I have to do. Don&rsquo;t you understand
that? Now, my dear boy, I shall go on cheerfully. Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the immortal village blacksmith, I can look the whole
world in the face again&mdash;well, not <i>quite</i> the whole world,
because I&rsquo;m already deeply in your debt; but all that
shall be wiped off some day, and we&rsquo;ll start with a clean
slate. Now, I sincerely hope that that woman hasn&rsquo;t
overcharged you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t bother about that if I were you,&rdquo; said
Comethup. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s paid and done with, and you won&rsquo;t
need to trouble about it. But how are you going on?
What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, that&rsquo;s a question for the future; and
the future, for good or ill, can always be depended upon
to take care of itself. For the present&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the
only really important thing&mdash;you have stepped in, like the
splendid chap you are, and have put all my world right.
I won&rsquo;t attempt to thank you: thanks between friends
are always meaningless. Let us go out somewhere and
look on the world, and be grateful, and sit in the sunshine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;You
see, I&rsquo;ve been away in the country for some time, and I
must hurry back home. I only called here on my way
from the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, some other day, then, although I wish you
could have made it to-day. I&rsquo;m just in the mood for a
holiday. So you&rsquo;ve been in the country, have you? What
part?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the old place, our old home, you know,&rdquo; replied
Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! the dear old spot! And I suppose you saw
all the old people and all the familiar sights of our boyhood.
Been staying there long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only about a week this time,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>The other caught him up quickly. &ldquo;<i>This</i> time! Do
you often go down there, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been down once or twice to&mdash;to see the
captain. You remember the captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;queer, stiff old chap!&mdash;I remember him very
well. I&mdash;I suppose the place hasn&rsquo;t changed much?&rdquo; He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
had walked across to a table, had picked up a cigarette,
and was lighting it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, very little,&rdquo; replied Comethup. &ldquo;People die,
and get married, and live the same lives that other people
did before them; nothing very exciting ever happens
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not. I&rsquo;ve half a mind to run down there
myself one of these days, just to dream among the old
streets where I lived when I was a boy; it would be rather
inspiring, I should think. Let me see: there was a little
girl&mdash;what the deuce was her name?&mdash;used to live there
in a house we thought was haunted. Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;She lives there
still; her father&rsquo;s dead, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t think I ever met him. But I see
you&rsquo;re impatient to be gone, so I won&rsquo;t detain you. By
the way&rdquo;&mdash;this as Comethup was moving toward the door&mdash;&ldquo;I
wish you would let me have&mdash;say a fiver. I hate to
ask you; but, you know, I haven&rsquo;t a shilling to bless myself
with, and although I get all I want here, still there
are some additional things which&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; said Comethup; &ldquo;I never thought
of that. Here you are. I&rsquo;ll come round and see you
again. I suppose you&rsquo;re working pretty hard now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not what you would call working; as a matter
of fact, I&rsquo;m waiting for an idea. I can feel it coming.
I know that at any moment of the night or day I may
wake up with the whole thing complete in my mind, ready
to put down on paper. But these things can&rsquo;t be forced&mdash;one
has to wait for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the other books?&rdquo; asked Comethup. &ldquo;I suppose
they&rsquo;re going well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Brian. &ldquo;From a point of view
of fame, they&rsquo;re going very well indeed; people are talking
about me, and I&rsquo;ve even been preached at from some
rather popular pulpits. Of course I get a little money
from them, and that money will increase as time goes on.
I don&rsquo;t mind confessing that I was in the depths of despair
this morning. Now I shall go out, and look my fellow-man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
in the face, and enjoy the sunshine, and slap myself
on the breast and say, &lsquo;Brian Carlaw, you are once
again a free man!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup left him and drove home. Miss Charlotte
Carlaw, even in the midst of an affectionate greeting, expressed
her surprise that he should not have telegraphed
the hour of his arrival, in order that the carriage might
meet him. He explained lamely that he had made up his
mind quite suddenly to return, and that there had been
no time for anything. Miss Carlaw sat in her accustomed
chair, amid a curious silence, for some moments, evidently
waiting for him to speak, feeling, probably, after
the confidence he had before given her, that there would
be something further to say. Delicacy urged her to be
silent, but impatience and anxiety for him prompted her
to speak, and at last she broke out, in characteristic
fashion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, boy, how fares the wooing? Do you come back
with a heart too big for your waistcoat to hold it, or has
the jade proved fickle and sent you about your business?
Come, I&rsquo;m an old woman&mdash;perhaps an old fool&mdash;but I&rsquo;m
tingling to know if she has used you well, and if you&rsquo;re
happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He crossed to her and stooped, and put an arm about
her shoulders and kissed her. &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; he said, with
a little laugh; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy that I can&rsquo;t express what I
feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her hand up and softly stroked the hand that
lay on her shoulder. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well, boy; that&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;And what did she say to you, and what did you
say to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots of things that I can&rsquo;t remember&mdash;lots of beautiful
things that I didn&rsquo;t think any one could ever say to
me,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t tell me; you&rsquo;ve evidently got it pretty
badly. I&rsquo;ve never seen this girl, and know nothing about
her; but I&rsquo;m quite sure that she&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s good and sweet
and true, or you wouldn&rsquo;t have selected her from all other
women. Just a word or two to you, my boy, although I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t think you need it; but I&rsquo;m a woman myself, and
women are strange creatures to deal with. Don&rsquo;t forget
that a girl is a thing of moods and whims and fancies&mdash;quite
the best of them are that&mdash;and they&rsquo;ve got to be
humoured, just like spoilt children. The world has
banded itself together for centuries past to spoil its womenkind&mdash;sometimes
in the best sense, generally in the
worst&mdash;and you can&rsquo;t blame the women if they&rsquo;ve learned
to take advantage of it. I think a woman wants to feel
that a man is her master, but she wants him to be a gentle
master, all the same. And there is no woman living
will love a man, in the best and finest way that a man
can be loved, unless she is first his friend and his comrade&mdash;unless,
unerringly, in time of doubt or trouble, her
thoughts fly to him. There! I&rsquo;ve done preaching. Now
tell me what you&rsquo;re going to do, or what&rsquo;s going to happen,
or what you&rsquo;ve determined on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve determined on anything yet,&rdquo;
said Comethup. &ldquo;You see, it seems only just to have happened.
I&rsquo;ve only just found out, as it were, that she
loves me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d be a fool if she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; ejaculated Miss Carlaw.
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to interfere in your love-making.
In your own good time I must make the girl&rsquo;s acquaintance.
In this, as in everything else, I leave all to
your own good judgment and common sense. Make your
own plans, and I&rsquo;ll back you up; I can&rsquo;t say more than
that. But remember that if at any time you want her to
come to London or to see me, this house is open to her,
and she may stay under my wing as long as she likes.
Selfishly, I&rsquo;m glad to hear she has no friends. Relatives
are a nuisance&mdash;at least, mine have always been. But
you know I don&rsquo;t include you in that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup&rsquo;s visits to the old town became of necessity
more frequent. It was splendid to think, as he started off
from London on each occasion, that in the desolate garden
would be waiting the woman who watched for his coming
and listened for his footsteps through weary days when
he could not reach her. Once or twice he had suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
that she should go to London as his aunt&rsquo;s guest, and see
all the wonders of that wonderful city; but she had hung
back shyly, pleading that there was plenty of time, or that
she liked better to see him down there. Always she had
some half-laughing excuse, so that he ceased at last to urge
her, and was content to live in the happy present, and to
leave the more formal questions of introduction and such
like matters to the future. Always, too, she was the same
petulant, impulsive, warm-hearted creature, quick to anger
and as sudden in her repentance; wounding him deeply
at times, and yet striving afterward to heal the wound
with so much of love and tenderness and self-reproach
that he would not willingly have been without the pain
which revealed to him such depths of wonderful compassion
in her. Each night, when he sought his bed, there
was some faint bitterness in his heart; and yet, greater
than the bitterness, the remembrance of some beautiful
phrases she had used, some sudden, half-shy glance of her
eyes, some wholly spontaneous caress. His love for her
grew with the wonder of her; but she seemed always so
intangible, so changeful, that he was never sure of her&mdash;was
forever, after he had parted from her, on the verge
of rushing back to crave her forgiveness for this, or her
clearer understanding of that.</p>

<p>Once, when he parted from her at night under the balcony,
she clung to him, held him for a moment after
they had whispered their &ldquo;Good-nights,&rdquo; and looked up
into his eyes. He saw her own were swimming in tears.
&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I wish I were kinder to you;
you deserve so much more than I can ever give you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve anything; you&rsquo;ve
given me already more than I ever hoped to gain. Why,
you&rsquo;re the best woman in the whole world, and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her hand quickly on his lips. &ldquo;And you are
the best man&mdash;better and more patient than any one else
could be. Tell me&rdquo;&mdash;she laid her head upon his breast,
and he had to bend his own to catch the words&mdash;&ldquo;tell me,
what would you do if you found&mdash;if it were possible that
I did not love you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>His arms closed more tightly about her. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
fair to jest about that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why should you think
about it at all? You do love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. But what would you do? Would it
mean&mdash;oh, how serious you are!&mdash;would it mean so much
to you? Think: I vex and trouble you a hundred times
a day. I know I do, only you&rsquo;re too good to say anything
about it. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if you loved some one&mdash;some
one who loved you steadily and firmly, just as you
deserve to be loved? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dearest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand. I&rsquo;m
only a youngster, I know; but I&rsquo;m quite sure I never could
love any one else; that I want you just as you are, whether
smiling or in tears, whether frowning&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t
happen often&mdash;or laughing. Although we&rsquo;ve been parted
such a long time, you seem to be the &rsquo;Linda who has
grown up with me; we&rsquo;ve been waiting for each other all
this time. Only you mustn&rsquo;t say such things as this, because
you hurt me. I can not think what I should do
without you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a smile, and drew his face
down and kissed him. &ldquo;Rest content,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Only be patient with me; I won&rsquo;t desert you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup walked home thoughtfully, holding that last
whispered phrase of hers steadily before him, and striving
to banish everything else. He found the captain
standing leaning over his garden gate, smoking a cheroot,
and looking up and down the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a note for you inside,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;it
was sent round from the Bell Inn an hour since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup, wondering a little, walked into the cottage,
followed leisurely by the captain. The note lay on the
little table, in the circle of light thrown by the lamp; the
young man picked it and tore it open. It was from Brian
Carlaw.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Friend in Need</span>: I am, so to speak, breathing
my native air; but, although there is a popular belief to
the effect that one&rsquo;s native air is beneficial, I find it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
wholly insufficient to support existence. I am treated
here with respect, not to say reverence; my fame (such
as it is) has preceded me, even to this benighted spot, and
the old place slaps itself upon the back approvingly because
it gave me birth; at the present moment I wish it
would give me something to eat. Providence, however,
watches over the weakest of its creatures, and I hear, by
accident, that you are staying within a hundred yards of
me. Imagine my ridiculous position: I am spoken of
with bated breath as a wonder, shedding lustre on all to
whom I will deign to nod, yet I have not the wherewithal
to pay my bill, and, moreover, I am burdened. Come and
smile upon me&mdash;and see the Burden.</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 10%;">&ldquo;Yours in distress,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Brian</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Comethup gave a little sigh as he folded up the note
and thrust it in his pocket. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from my cousin,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s staying at the Bell; he wants me to go over
and see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he ill?&rdquo; asked the captain, shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think he is ill; he doesn&rsquo;t say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should have thought he might have troubled
himself to walk over here,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;without
sending for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he wasn&rsquo;t quite sure of finding me in,&rdquo; said
Comethup. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better run over and see him; he
wants to see me. I&rsquo;m sorry to rush out again, sir, in this
unceremonious fashion, but I won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, my boy,&rdquo; replied the captain.
&ldquo;Only you know my prejudice against your cousin,
and I&rsquo;m not particularly glad to find that he&rsquo;s down
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup deemed it wiser to make no answer; he put
on his hat and went off to the inn to find Brian. The
little old-fashioned bar of the place seemed unusually full
that night, and much animated talk was going on. As
Comethup inquired for his cousin, a hush fell upon those
in the place, and curious looks were directed toward him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
It was evident that Brian&rsquo;s appearance had created something
of the stir he had suggested.</p>

<p>Brian was in the most jovial humour, and came forward
to greet him with a cry of delight. There stepped
forward another figure also&mdash;Mr. Robert Carlaw&mdash;who
grasped his hand warmly, and allowed a smile of relief to
break over features which had before worn a look of anxiety.
Comethup concluded that this must be the Burden
referred to in the letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear chap,&rdquo; began Brian boisterously, &ldquo;I know
you&rsquo;ll laugh when you hear everything; you&rsquo;ll split yourself
with laughter at our expense. You know, another
man in my position would see the grim side of it, the sordid
side; I only see the humorous one. Look at my respected
dad; saw you ever such a figure of melancholy?
You must know that I made up my mind to come down
to my native place&mdash;I think I hinted something of the
sort when I saw you in London. I pined for old sights,
and old sounds, and familiar faces; I heard again
the babble of the brooks of my youth, the songs of the
birds whose nests I robbed in boyhood&rsquo;s hour. Well, I
was just preparing to start when my wonderful parent
put in an appearance; we hadn&rsquo;t seen each other for a
considerable period. &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; says he.
&lsquo;To the home of my birth,&rsquo; says I. Then, like the historic
milkmaid, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rsquo; says he. And here
we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my son,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Robert Carlaw gravely,
&ldquo;the worst has yet to be told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst? The best, you mean; quite the best.&mdash;You
know, my dear Comethup, our preposterous fashion
of taking life&mdash;a sort of childlike belief that the ravens,
or some other well-disposed persons, will feed us. Well,
you don&rsquo;t need to be told that my disgraceful parent and
myself discovered, when we arrived here, that we hadn&rsquo;t
a sovereign between us; and this, too, after we had, in the
lightness of our hearts, secured the best rooms that the
place could afford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget, my dear Brian,&rdquo; interrupted his father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
&ldquo;that that was <i>my</i> suggestion. I considered it necessary,
for the sake of your reputation here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; laughed Brian; &ldquo;but we
quite forgot, in the innocence of our hearts, that these
people knew that you had met with disaster in the shape
of bankruptcy. The consequence is that I see that most
terrible thing&mdash;the greed of gold&mdash;beginning to glitter
in their eyes. However, we&rsquo;re here, and we&rsquo;ve got to make
the best of it. I suppose we must be fed, and I suppose
these good people must be paid. Therefore, as I say,
Providence has been good to us and has sent us&rdquo;&mdash;he
bowed with charming frankness toward his cousin&mdash;&ldquo;Comethup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The humour of the thing began to appeal to Comethup
also. Perhaps it was better that that side of the
matter should strike him most clearly, for the rest had
become so much a matter of course, that Brian should send
to him when the slightest difficulty arose, that he had long
since ceased to wonder at it or to be surprised. It was
evident that both father and son regarded the thing not as
a charity, but as their right; whatever might have been
their first feelings, custom had blunted them. Comethup,
for his part, could never quite divest his mind of the
idea that he was giving an alms, and he tried, therefore,
always to carry the business through as delicately. It was
evident here that, in a place where Brian&rsquo;s reputation
must at all hazards be first considered, there must be no
thought of paying the bill directly; appearances must be
kept up, and father and son must sail out of their difficulties
with flying colours and in good attitudes. That
was obviously a matter for Comethup to arrange; it was
evident that they waited for him to set about the task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you intend to stay here long?&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About a week, I think,&rdquo; said Brian. &ldquo;The truth is,
I&rsquo;m a little rusty, and, despite all the delights of town,
I sigh for the simplicity of the country-side. Yes, I
think about a week; by that time we shall both be bored
to death, or shall have had a violent quarrel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Brian!&rdquo; interrupted his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And shall have mutually cursed each other and gone
our separate ways, until the time arrives for another reconciliation.
That&rsquo;s our gentle method of getting through
life. At the present moment we are amiability itself;
but how long it will last it is quite impossible to say. Do
you think we can manage a week here, Comethup? It&rsquo;s
not a very expensive place, and the wines, which are atrocious,
are not at all dear. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s for <i>you</i> to say,&rdquo; responded Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; interrupted his uncle, &ldquo;it is for <i>you</i>
to say. In our present embarrassed circumstances, we
wait&mdash;I may say, with hopes which are certain to be realized&mdash;we
wait on the word of one who has ever proved
our friend. I say it not without emotion; I have recollections
of many occasions on which&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian broke in boisterously. &ldquo;Here, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake,
don&rsquo;t start a sermon, dad! Comethup doesn&rsquo;t want it, and
it won&rsquo;t improve me; and you, for your part, don&rsquo;t mean
a word of it. Comethup quite understands the circumstances&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you, old chap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; replied Comethup hurriedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in
rather&mdash;rather a hurry, and if you will let me know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much we want?&rdquo; Brian finished the hesitating
sentence airily, and Comethup was grateful to him.
&ldquo;Well, suppose you let us have&mdash;dad&rsquo;s an expensive chap
to keep, and I don&rsquo;t want to be forever worrying you&mdash;suppose
you let us have a hundred. I&rsquo;ll look after it
myself, and be strictly economical; and long before it&rsquo;s
all gone my new book will be out and I shall have
made my fortune. This next volume will certainly
make my fortune&mdash;in an indefinable fashion, I feel sure
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t so much money with me, of course,&rdquo;
said Comethup, &ldquo;but I can give you a cheque, and they&rsquo;ll
clear it for you at the local bank, if that will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellently,&rdquo; exclaimed Brian. &ldquo;What a wonderfully
generous fellow you are! Any one would think you
had been sent expressly into the world to come to my aid
at stated intervals and lift all worry from my shoulders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
That you should be down here at this very hour&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the wonderful part of the business!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup wrote the cheque, and escaped as quickly as
possible from their thanks. Mr. Robert Carlaw found it
necessary to open the door for him, and even to accompany
him down the stairs and through the bar, waving
aside haughtily some common person who stood in the
way. Outside, in the quiet moonlit street, he placed a
hand on Comethup&rsquo;s shoulder and looked at him and
sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear nephew,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;fortune has not been
good to me. True, it has placed certain riches within
my grasp; but Providence, on the other hand, has cursed
me with a temperament which compels me to do all things
greatly&mdash;on a large scale, as it were. I think I told you
once that I felt I was meant to cut a figure&mdash;to loom
large in the eye of the world. There are men cutting figures
to-day who are but objects of contempt; they are
not fitted, physically or mentally, for the parts they play.
With me, it would have been different. I have, and I say
it in all seriousness, tact, discernment, and a certain refinement,
and&mdash;shall I say it?&mdash;delicacy, which all men
do not possess. Yet I am a most unhappy man; I am
growing old&mdash;no, do not attempt to contradict me; I feel
that I am growing old&mdash;and I am compelled to seek my
bread in the most precarious fashion&mdash;to be dependent
even on the whim of my own son.&rdquo; He lowered his voice,
and glanced toward the inn door. &ldquo;This money you have
been generous enough to place in his hands&mdash;no doubt he
will spend it with what wisdom he can, but I&mdash;I shall
see nothing of it. And you must be aware that there are
services rendered to me daily&mdash;by servants and others in
humble positions&mdash;for which a gentleman must pay, if he
would keep clear that distinction which is necessary between
class and mass. You grasp my meaning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup nodded. &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I had
not thought of that. Will you permit me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are ever generous, my dear nephew,&rdquo; murmured
Mr. Robert Carlaw as he thrust the flimsy banknotes into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
his waistcoat pocket. &ldquo;Once more I can hold up my head
before my fellows; once more I can feel that I am not
wholly dependent on my son. Good-night, my dear
friend; good-night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup was halfway home when some curious feeling
made him turn in the direction of &rsquo;Linda&rsquo;s house.
The town was quiet, and no one was in sight in any of
the streets through which he passed; he crept in through
the garden and went and stood under the balcony, looking
up at the house, which was in complete darkness.
And as he looked there came back to him the words she
had uttered; not the words of comfort he had tried so
resolutely to hold before him, but those others which held
a vague fear for him, &ldquo;What would you do if you found
I did not love you?&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="subheading">THE DESERTION OF A PARENT.</p>


<p>Comethup saw but little of his cousin during the week
which followed. Once or twice he met him, riding wildly
about in some of the country lanes on a horse he had
hired, on which occasions he drew rein with a shout, and
generally announced that he was having &ldquo;a splendid
time,&rdquo; and that he would be able to go back to work feeling
much better for the holiday.</p>

<p>During that week, too, Comethup was left very much
with the captain, for &rsquo;Linda, without warning, broke several
engagements she had made to go out with them,
pleading afterward that she had had headaches or that
there had been work to be done. One evening, as Comethup,
after waiting all day in the hope of seeing her, was
making his way to her house he met his cousin Brian
swinging out through the gates. They stopped, in mutual
surprise, and then Brian linked his arm in that of the
other and began to lead him away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a lucky meeting!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I was just
wondering what I was to do with myself all the evening,
and how I was to pass the time until I could decently
go to bed. Come along. What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you must excuse me,&rdquo; said Comethup.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t join you to-night; I&rsquo;m just going to see
&rsquo;Linda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just seen her,&rdquo; said Brian, looking at him with
a smile. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me, you rogue, anything about
the business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What business?&rdquo; asked Comethup, a little coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, your engagement, of course. Well, I congratulate
you. Our little friend has certainly grown into a
lovely woman, but she always gave promise of that. My
dear boy, you come in for all the good things; what <i>have</i>
you done to deserve them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose I&rsquo;m very lucky,&rdquo; said Comethup. He
hesitated for a moment, and then held out his hand.
&ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it&rsquo;s no use your going in now,&rdquo; said Brian;
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s gone to bed; got a headache or something of the
kind. You won&rsquo;t be able to see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to the house at all events,&rdquo; said
Comethup doggedly; &ldquo;I can at least inquire how she is.
Good-night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Brian, and shrugged his shoulders
and walked away.</p>

<p>Comethup went through the garden, and stood under
the balcony. A light was burning in the room in which
he had once sat with &rsquo;Linda, but the long French windows
were closed. He climbed the steps and walked to
the windows and looked in; Mrs. Dawson sat beside the
table sewing. He knocked upon the pane, and then thrust
open the window and walked in. She looked up quietly,
letting her work rest under her hands in her lap. For a
moment neither of them spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Linda?&rdquo; he asked at last. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone to her room,&rdquo; replied the woman, looking
at him in some surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But she can not have gone long, and I want to see
her,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She gave me strict instructions she was not to be
disturbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! but she didn&rsquo;t know that I was coming to her.
I must see her; I haven&rsquo;t seen her all day, although she
promised to meet me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman rose slowly from her seat and laid her
work on the table; she came toward him, looking at him
with a curious intentness. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen her all
day? Then who was with her in the garden just now,
and why did she run in crying? I saw that, although
she hid her face from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Comethup, with a miserable
pain beginning to gnaw at his heart. &ldquo;I suspect&mdash;I know
you&rsquo;re mistaken, as you were before, when you thought
she met some one. But will you please go and tell her
that I am here, and that I should like to see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without another word Mrs. Dawson went out of the
room, and he heard her quick feet ascending the stairs.
Within a few minutes she returned, and stood just within
the doorway of the room, looking at him. &ldquo;She says you
must forgive her, but she can not see you to-night. She
will see you to-morrow. And she sends you her love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he had to be content, and he went away
through the garden and through the streets back to the
captain&rsquo;s cottage. All night long he lay wide awake, turning
over the matter in his mind, seeing again Brian coming
striding out of the garden, picturing in imagination
an interview between him and the girl which ended in
tears for her. But with the morning, just as he was thinking
of getting up, came a little rattle of pebbles at his
window; he scrambled out of bed and looked from behind
the curtain. Below, in the garden, was &rsquo;Linda, smiling
up at him, and with that smile all the troublous doubts
and fears of the night were gone in a flash.</p>

<p>He nodded to her, and scampered through his dressing
and ran down to join her. She was in her most playful
and bewitching mood; she caught both his hands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
danced round him like a happy child, and dragged him
into the house and kissed him before he had recovered
breath to greet her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, see what a change the morning brings!&rdquo; she
cried, her eyes dancing. &ldquo;Last night I hated all the
world, and hated myself most of all; this morning the
world is lovely, and I am lovely&mdash;<i>you</i> might have said
that, sir!&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to be good for evermore, and
never, never give my dear boy the slightest cause for a
heartache.&rdquo; Between laughter and tears she kissed him
again, and clung to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you never have given me cause for that,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;When I feel your arms about me and your lips on
mine&mdash;well, nothing that has happened can matter at all;
you seem to sweep everything else away. I was a little
disappointed yesterday that I did not see you, but this
more than makes up for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re quite sure that you forgive me&mdash;that this
<i>does</i> make up for it? Oh, my dear, I want you always
to think of these best moments of mine, and to forget
all the bad ones. See, with this bright morning I&rsquo;ll begin
over again; I&rsquo;ll be so good, so tender, so devoted to you
that you shall never have cause to think badly of me; all
my moments shall be best moments from this hour; everything
else shall be forgotten. Here&rsquo;s the captain coming;
kiss me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was in the same mood during breakfast, and for
all that long and happy day. She strove, in a hundred
ways, to blot out the memory of pain she had caused him&mdash;strove,
by her present tenderness, to cover up past moments
of petulance or anger. Yet there was in it all such
a striving, such a sense of trying to do that which should
have come naturally, without any striving, that even the
good captain, simple gentleman though he was, looked at
her more than once in surprise, and wondered what Comethup
thought. But Comethup was blissfully happy, and
only found time to bitterly accuse himself more than once
of having been unjust in his thoughts toward her.</p>

<p>A second completely happy day followed that first one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
and at the end of it he walked home with her to her house,
lingering with her until the last moment to put off their
parting. As they walked slowly under the great trees
toward the balcony, a man came strolling toward them,
with the glow of the cigarette he was smoking making a
little point of light in the darkness. The girl had had
both hands locked on Comethup&rsquo;s arm; she took the hands
quickly away when they came face to face with Brian.
He stopped, pulled off his hat with a flourish, and laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dreaming of romantic things,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;and lo and behold! I step suddenly&mdash;an intruder, I fear&mdash;into
the very heart of romance itself. Happy lovers
wandering in the starlight! Why, all the dreams I have
dreamed and all the poor verses I have scribbled are as
nothing to this; I have yet to learn the very first trick
of my trade&mdash;love at first hand. And who shall teach
me?&rdquo; He glanced, with a sort of comical wistfulness,
at the girl, who had drawn a little away from Comethup,
and whose eyes were fixed on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll find some one to teach you, I&rsquo;ve no doubt,&rdquo;
said Comethup, with a laugh. &ldquo;What has brought you
wandering here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to see an old friend&mdash;&rsquo;Linda,&rdquo; responded
Brian. &ldquo;Will she forgive me if I suggest that, in these
rose-coloured days, she is apt to forget a poor fellow who
was once her friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl looked up quickly, with a flush on her face.
&ldquo;Indeed, I forget none of my old friends,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Why should you think that?&rdquo; Comethup, looking at
her, saw in her eyes an appeal to the man, a look half of
defiance and of a resolution to keep firmly to her promise
of the previous day&mdash;half of a pity for him, and a fear of
him or of what he might say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps I don&rsquo;t quite think that,&rdquo; said Brian
carelessly. &ldquo;Only it&rsquo;s been my experience through life
to find that one is so easily forgotten, so easily thrust
out of remembrance, when one is penniless and&mdash;helpless.
You think that unjust, perhaps? There, I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m
in a wrong mood to-night, and I&rsquo;ve waited so long in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
infernal garden, on the chance of seeing an old friend,
that I&rsquo;ve got the horrors. Good-night, happy lovers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned on his heel, and went swinging away down
the avenue, singing a song softly to himself as he went.
The girl stood looking after him for a moment&mdash;stood
quite still until Comethup touched her arm and recalled
her to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, it&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; she answered, almost mechanically.
She did not put her hand again on his arm as they walked
toward the house, and, at the foot of the steps leading
to the balcony, when he would have drawn her into his
arms, she put out her hands and held him gently away
from her. &ldquo;You have had kisses enough for one day,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;you will tire of me if I yield always so easily.
Good-night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her wistfully for a moment, and then
raised her hands to his lips and let her go. She ran up
the steps and in through the window without once looking
round at him.</p>

<p>A letter from Miss Charlotte Carlaw, written in the
stiff round hand which the use of the writing frame demanded,
awaited him at the captain&rsquo;s cottage. She was
suddenly possessed by an idea, she wrote, to visit the old
town and to make the acquaintance of &rsquo;Linda Vernier,
quite in an informal fashion, for herself. But she wanted
her boy&rsquo;s arm to lean upon, and she did not care to make
the journey alone. Would he come to town to fetch her?
If he could tear himself away from his sweetheart for so
long, and would come to London the next day, he could
sleep in town that night and they could go down together
on the day following. She knew, she added, that the
captain&rsquo;s house was a small one, and would be glad, therefore,
if Comethup would take rooms for her at the best
inn he could find.</p>

<p>Comethup, reproaching himself that he had of late left
her so much alone, showed the letter to the captain, who
immediately proposed to turn out of his own house for
her accommodation. But Comethup laughingly assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
him that his aunt would never consent to that; the only
question was about the choice of an inn. To take her
to the Bell was clearly impossible, since Mr. Robert Carlaw
and his son were apparently firmly established there.
Finally, it was decided to engage rooms at a smaller place,
the captain assuring the young man that the accommodation,
although limited, was of the best. The next morning
Comethup started for London.</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Carlaw was filled with a pleasurable
excitement at the prospect of meeting the girl&mdash;talked of
nothing else, in fact, on the journey down. They came
in the old fashion to Deal, and thence drove, arriving at
the inn late in the afternoon. It had been arranged that
Miss Carlaw, after tea and a rest, should proceed to the
captain&rsquo;s house for dinner; on this point the captain had
firmly insisted, and had spent two sleepless nights over a
consideration of the courses. There &rsquo;Linda was to meet
her. Comethup had posted a letter to her before leaving
for London explaining his hurried departure, and begging
that she would meet his aunt, as suggested, at the captain&rsquo;s
house.</p>

<p>Miss Carlaw, who had asked a casual question as to
why rooms had not been taken at the Bell, and had been
informed that those she had formerly occupied were engaged,
presented herself punctually at the hour appointed
for dinner, supported by Comethup. The captain was in
something of a flutter, and kept trotting in and out of the
room and holding whispered consultations with Homer.
&rsquo;Linda had not arrived, and Comethup glanced more than
once anxiously at his watch. At last Miss Carlaw, seated
in the chair of state and leaning her chin upon her stick,
faced round upon him a little impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Punctuality is a virtue, my dear boy,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;and that lady-love of yours is twenty minutes late. I
can understand modesty and shyness and all that kind
of thing, although I don&rsquo;t think I ever suffered with those
complaints myself; but the captain&rsquo;s dinner is spoilt, and
I&rsquo;m ravenously hungry. I think you had better go and
look for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>Comethup gladly seized the opportunity. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
it be better,&rdquo; he said, as he was going out of the room,
&ldquo;if you went on with dinner? &rsquo;Linda will only feel a
thousand times more nervous if she thinks you have been
waiting; whereas, if I bring her in quite in an ordinary
way&mdash;well, she won&rsquo;t feel so embarrassed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, these lovers!&rdquo; ejaculated Miss Carlaw. &ldquo;Well,
I suppose you&rsquo;re right; so I&rsquo;ll ask the captain to have dinner
in at once. And you&rsquo;re both young&mdash;just make her
run for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup ran at top speed to the house, and went
plunging through the garden and up the steps to the balcony.
Scarcely waiting to knock, he flung open the long
window and stepped into the room. Mrs. Dawson was
there, not sewing quietly as usual, but pacing up and
down the room. She stopped in her walk for a moment
and faced him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Linda!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Is she ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not seen her for some hours,&rdquo; replied the
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not seen her? But I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took a note from the table and held it out to him.
&ldquo;I found this here just now; it is addressed to you. I
had been out, and came back and found it here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There seemed a dreadful silence about the house and
in the room; the very noise of the ripping of the envelope
seemed to hurt him. He pulled the letter out, and came
forward to the light to read it. And this is what he read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear, dear Boy</span>: If I had not been a coward, if
I had been, in anything, worthy of all your tenderness,
your goodness, and your love for me, I might have faced
you, and told you what you will here find written, and
trusted to your mercy. I think now that if you were here,
and held my hands and looked into my eyes with those
deep, honest eyes of yours, I could not do what I must
do&mdash;I could not leave you. God knows what a long and
bitter fight it has been; how I have told myself, again
and again, that you were the best man on earth, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
nothing should change my love for you. Believe that I
meant that always; believe that I have tried, with prayers
and tears, to shut everything else out. When first I met
you, after we had grown to be man and woman, I carried
something in my heart of which I dared not speak&mdash;the
love of another man. On the first night that I ran
down to meet you in the garden I thought he had come
back to me. Now he has come back indeed, and all my
world is changed, and I can cheat myself and you no
longer. He is poor, and friendless, and helpless, but he
will one day be a great man; and I, though I am but a
poor, timid girl, can help him a little to his greatness as
no one else can possibly do. If I am a coward, in running
away and fearing to face you, forgive that, as you
have forgiven so much else. We go to London this afternoon;
we shall be married to-morrow. Something is tugging
hard at my heart while I write this; you have been
always so good to me that I seem to see you reading it.
Forgive me; if you can find it in your big heart to do that,
you will not quite forget&mdash;</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 10%;">&ldquo;Your friend,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">&rsquo;Linda</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>He read it all through slowly, in a dazed fashion, and
then quietly folded the paper, pleating it up small in his
fingers and staring down at it. Mrs. Dawson had drawn
nearer to him, and now laid her hand on his arm. He
looked round at her like some great helpless animal that
has been wounded, and can not understand why the blow
should have been struck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong. What has happened?&rdquo; she
asked, in a quick whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; he said. Then came the quick instinct,
the very dawning of a purpose he was to keep so
clearly before him afterward, that she must be protected;
that her good name must be held high and clear in all
men&rsquo;s sight, that none might smirch it. He actually
forced a laugh to his lips as he thrust the paper into his
pocket. &ldquo;There&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing wrong, nothing wrong
at all; you needn&rsquo;t look so frightened. It&rsquo;s only&mdash;only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
little love story&mdash;a love story none of us guessed. Curious,
isn&rsquo;t it? She tells me here as&mdash;as an old friend, that
she&rsquo;s run away&mdash;there, don&rsquo;t cry out&mdash;she&rsquo;s run away to
get married. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To get married! But who is the man? Are you
sure that he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sterner light came into Comethup&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I am quite sure. They will be married at once.
You must be very fond of her,&rdquo; he added gently, &ldquo;to take
the matter so much to heart. But I suppose any one could
get fond of her quite easily. And you&rsquo;ve been with her
a number of years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman looked at him with a forlorn expression
of countenance, and clasped her hands and began to weep,
not with any violence but in a hopeless, helpless way that
was more terrible than anything else could possibly have
been. The secret she had borne so long, the story of that
shameful flight which she had been compelled at first to
keep from her child, and later had kept for her own sake,
seemed to weigh more heavily now than it could have
done at any other time. She had seen the child grow to
girlhood, and then to womanhood; had been content with
what tenderness she could win from her, in her position
as a tried and faithful friend, fearing to jeopardize even
that small happiness by any avowal of the true relationship
between them.</p>

<p>Comethup left her, and went slowly out through the
garden again. He had forgotten everything but that one
thought&mdash;that she was gone&mdash;forgotten that, within two
hundred yards of him, his aunt and the captain awaited
his arrival, and would look for an explanation. In quite
an aimless way he got into the streets, and walked until
he found himself outside the Bell Inn. Scarcely knowing
what he did, he went up the stairs, turned the handle
of the door, and walked into the room in which
he had seen Brian and his father. Mr. Robert Carlaw
was standing by the fireplace, looking into the glass;
he turned round sharply as Comethup entered the
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Brian has gone, I hear?&rdquo; said Comethup, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw flung out his hands with a despairing
gesture. &ldquo;It is true, sir. With that base ingratitude
which has ever been his chief characteristic he has deserted
me in the hour of my need. More than all, he has
taken with him the whole of the money you were generous
enough to place in our hands, and which I was foolish
enough to leave in his keeping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; said Comethup half to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
glad he&rsquo;s got some money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad, sir! And pray what is to become of <i>me</i>?&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Carlaw. &ldquo;Have I lavished the tenderest
care upon him for years past; have I sacrificed everything
to him; have I raced, in my declining years, through
strange and vile places of the earth, in order to be near
him and to protect him; have I done all this to be deserted
now, at the last, for a wretched jade&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Comethup quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you
don&rsquo;t quite understand the situation. There is no question
of any &lsquo;wretched jade,&rsquo; as you describe her. Brian
has merely decided to marry the sweetest and best girl
that there is in the world. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re quite
wise to talk in that fashion, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d do it
if I were in your place. I&rsquo;ve no doubt you&rsquo;ll see Brian
again shortly. At the present moment, as he has been,
well, let us say compelled to take the money for necessary
expenses, perhaps you will allow me to replace what you
consider you have lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very good, my dear nephew; you are always
more than generous. Forgive me if I spoke in haste. But
consider the position: my son, who is just entering, as I
might say, into his kingdom, who has the ball, as it were,
at his feet, to marry a girl like this, whom no one knows
and who has never been heard of! Why, it&rsquo;s shocking&mdash;positively
terrible! With his face, and his figure, and his
talents he might easily have gone one better than his poor
old father, and been snapped up by a duchess. Such things
<i>have</i> occurred.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; said Comethup wearily. &ldquo;I just&mdash;just
called here to see you. I only heard a little while ago
that Brian had left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He left a note for me,&rdquo; said Mr. Carlaw, &ldquo;informing
me coolly that he purposed getting married to-morrow,
and that, as he wanted money for current expenses, he&rsquo;d
taken what there was, and had no doubt that I should
&lsquo;fall on my feet.&rsquo; Fall on my feet, indeed!&mdash;a fine expression
to use to a father! What did he think was going
to become of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he remembered that I was still in the
town,&rdquo; replied Comethup quietly. &ldquo;When do you return
to London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Immediately; it is useless for me to stay here. I
must discover my erring boy; I can not rest until I have
effected a reconciliation with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup was glad to bring the interview to an end.
He left Mr. Robert Carlaw smilingly fingering a cheque,
and came out into the cool night air. Even then he did
not care to go back to the cottage; he wandered on, stumbling
now and then like a man half asleep, and came back
presently to the broken gates of the garden in which he
had walked so often with her. In the darkness of it he
almost fancied that there hovered the white figure of the
child he had seen as a boy; he almost thought he heard
the piteous, pleading, childish voice calling to him from
among the trees. He laid his arms against one of the
trees, and rested his head upon them, and remained there
in the solitary place for quite a long time. He did not
weep; the bitterness of the thing lay too deep for tears.
Young though he was, he looked up at the stars that were
peeping through the branches, and wondered how he
should live and what he should do, and how the world
would go on, now that she had left it empty. He took
the letter out of his pocket and put it to his lips, for she
had written it, and there was some small consolation even
in that.</p>

<p>How should he tell them? That was his next thought;
how to get the miserable business explained, so that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
might afterward be set aside and forgotten and done with.
He waited for some time outside the captain&rsquo;s cottage,
debating what to do, and finally crept in cautiously and
stood just within the doorway of the room, and beckoned
to the captain. His aunt sat with her back to him, and
was quite unaware of his presence.</p>

<p>The captain stared at him for a moment as though he
had been a ghost, then rose, and, with a muttered word
of apology to Miss Carlaw, came out to him. Not a word
was said until they stood outside in the little garden, with
the cottage door closed and the two men looking into each
other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; said Comethup; and for the first time,
with his old friend&rsquo;s hand in his, his fortitude gave way
and he turned his head aside. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone away, this
afternoon, with the man she loves&mdash;gone to be married.
You see, sir, I made a mistake&mdash;put her in a false position,
as it were. But, of course, it is all right now&mdash;and
she&rsquo;s gone to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain stood perfectly still for nearly a minute
without speaking; then he said slowly, &ldquo;And the man&mdash;who
is the man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cousin, Brian. I suppose I ought to have known
from the very first that she must love him, and not me.
You see, he&rsquo;s such a different sort of fellow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; murmured the captain, under
his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now all we have to think about is how to tell
my aunt. You see, it&rsquo;s rather a foolish business: we&rsquo;ve
brought her down here under false pretences, as it were,
and there&rsquo;ll be such a lot to explain, won&rsquo;t there? And
I want, for a little time at least, to forget all about it,
just as though it hadn&rsquo;t happened. Shall we go in and
tell her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose we must,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;You
know her better than I do; but I think she will understand,
and will not trouble you with many questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed together into the cottage. Miss Charlotte
Carlaw must have heard the sound of the voices outside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
and must have recognised that something was wrong.
She sat quite still, with her hands resting on her stick,
but her face wore a curiously anxious expression. Comethup
crossed to the window and stood there, at some distance
from her, wondering how he should begin. She
waited for some moments, and then turned piteously toward
the captain, and from him to her nephew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will no one speak? What has happened? Comethup,
my dear boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a mistake,&rdquo; said Comethup, speaking
in slow, steady tones. &ldquo;I suppose we all make mistakes
some time or other in life, and I&rsquo;ve read somewhere that
a man makes them most of all when he&rsquo;s in love. So you
see, aunt, <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> made a mistake; have dreamed a poor, foolish
dream; have pictured to myself something that didn&rsquo;t
exist. The lady I&mdash;I thought I was in love with was all
the time secretly in love with some one else, and to-day
they&rsquo;ve gone away to be married. Please don&rsquo;t speak to
me; please let me explain. And I want you, first of all,
to remember that it is not her fault, and never has been;
the blunder has been mine, in cheating myself into the
belief that she cared for me. It really isn&rsquo;t her fault, and
I&rdquo;&mdash;he gave a queer little laugh&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite happy, and
I say, with all my heart, &lsquo;God bless her and her husband!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Carlaw&rsquo;s perception must have been
keener even than the captain had imagined. At the first,
when Comethup began his blundering explanation, she had
shown signs of a rising indignation, but as the pitiful
recital went on her face changed, and her head was bowed
slowly over the top of her stick. The captain stole quietly
from the room, and the old woman raised her head at last
and held out her hand toward her nephew. &ldquo;My dear
boy,&rdquo; was all she said, but in the words was a sympathy
so great that he could scarce restrain his tears. He did
not feel strong enough to go near her yet, and so he said,
with what lightness he could call into his voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we have dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there nothing more you wish to say to me?&rdquo; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
asked. &ldquo;Oh, my dear boy, is there nothing you wish to
say? You speak as lightly as though&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And think as lightly, I hope,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
made&mdash;made a blunder; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She dropped her stick, and stretched out both hands to
him. He stepped forward then and took the hands and
kissed her. &ldquo;O Comethup!&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I never
wanted eyes so much as I want them to-night. I want to
see your face!&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="subheading">GENIUS AND THE DOMESTIC VIRTUES.</p>


<p>In all the time which followed, Miss Charlotte Carlaw
never once alluded to the scene of that evening. That,
with womanly instinct, she drew her own conclusions is
certain; that, in her own characteristically fierce fashion,
she cursed the girl for a fool and a jilt is equally certain;
but to Comethup she strove in every possible fashion to
teach him to forget the mishap, to take his mind as much
as possible from the sorry business. She could not cheat
herself into the belief that she succeeded; her quick senses
told her that the added tenderness in his voice and an
additional gentleness in his manner were but the outcome
of all that he suffered in silence.</p>

<p>They returned to town on the day following &rsquo;Linda&rsquo;s
flight, and two days after that a letter was forwarded to
Comethup by the captain&mdash;an impudent, paltry thing,
which yet gave him some small satisfaction.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear young Cr&oelig;sus</span>: The race is not always to
the swift, nor the battle to the strong. I&rsquo;ve no doubt
that at the present moment you are thirsting for my blood,
and pouring out threats against me; yet I should be glad,
for the sake of our old friendship and because I am grateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
for certain services you have rendered me, that we
might still be friends. You can&rsquo;t have everything in this
world; and once upon a time, when probably you didn&rsquo;t
know any better, you stole my birthright. At the present
moment I have stolen what was never yours. It was a
mere girlish infatuation on her part, and one which you
should have been wise enough never to take seriously.
You wouldn&rsquo;t see that you were in the way, and
you forced me to adopt the only course possible. I am
convinced of one thing, and that is, that my new life with
her will give me just that stimulus which has somehow
been wanting in all my efforts. We were married on the
day following our flight to London, so that you need not,
in your innocence, blush for me or for her. We are going
into the country for what is technically known as the
honeymoon, and then we return to town and I start seriously
to work. I will let you know my address.</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 10%;">&ldquo;Yours sympathetically,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Brian Carlaw</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>He tore the letter up and went about his daily life,
determined, if possible, now that the matter was ended,
to shut it all out of his mind. Miss Carlaw, with the
same kindly object in view, proposed a flight to the Continent,
and, believing that it would please her to go, he
gladly fell in with the suggestion. They were absent
nearly two months.</p>

<p>As they travelled with much the same state they had
adopted on their former journeyings&mdash;putting up at the
best hotels and staying in the largest cities&mdash;they were
easily to be traced. This Comethup was soon to discover,
for one night in Rome, after a solitary ramble through
the streets, a note was handed him as he entered his hotel;
he was informed that it had been left by a gentleman,
who would return in half an hour. He tore it open, and
discovered that it was written hurriedly in pencil and was
signed by Robert Carlaw, that the writer begged for a few
moments&rsquo; conversation with him on a matter of emergency.
Comethup hesitated for a moment, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
strolled out into the streets again, lingering about near
the entrance of the hotel. He had no desire to meet his
aunt, and then arouse her suspicions by leaving her again.</p>

<p>In a little while he saw Mr. Robert Carlaw approaching
him, swinging along with something of the old jaunty
step, and setting his hat a little more rakishly on his head
as he approached his destination. Yet there was, with
all his jauntiness, a certain lack of confidence about the
man&mdash;in his movements and in his glances&mdash;which may
have been inspired by the needy life he had led. Comethup
stood watching him as he neared the hotel entrance,
and saw that he did not turn boldly in, but lingered for a
moment outside, looking in furtively. As Comethup
walked toward him a look of relief stole over his face, and
he went toward the young man with both hands outstretched.
Comethup grasped one of the hands, and his
own was immediately covered by the other and warmly
pressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear young friend,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Robert Carlaw,
&ldquo;how good it is to set eyes once again upon you!
May I dare say that I have hungered for a sight of you?
I trust you have not waited long here for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;But I thought that if you
wished to see me we might talk here more easily than in
the hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True&mdash;true,&rdquo; murmured his uncle; &ldquo;you are ever considerate.
And I, who am, and have been for a long time,
nothing but a houseless wanderer, a wretch who dare not
meet the eye of his tailor, to say nothing of his butcher
and his baker, I seem to shun the lighted halls of luxury,
and to choose, as befitting my own fallen fortunes, the
darker ways of life. But enough of me.&rdquo; He made a
dramatic gesture, sighed, and linked his arm in that
of the young man and strolled on with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in no fresh trouble, I hope,&rdquo; said Comethup.
He longed to speak of &rsquo;Linda, to ask if she were happy,
to be certain that all was well with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Fresh</i> trouble!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Carlaw. &ldquo;Would
that any trouble which I suffered could, in any sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the word, be termed &rsquo;fresh&rsquo;! They are all too old and
stale for that. I am buried to the neck in them, am forever
struggling to the lips in a horrid sea of them, expecting
to be drowned every moment. Once or twice a generous
fellow, who shall be nameless&rdquo;&mdash;he squeezed Comethup&rsquo;s
arm&mdash;&ldquo;has thrown, to carry the metaphor further,
a life-line to me, and has drawn me ashore for a space.
But ill fortune has thrust me back again in time, and
each time I seem to sink deeper than ever. But enough
of myself; I am the emissary of others.&rdquo; He said it with
an air as though he felt it conferred a distinction upon
him that he was not on this occasion personally begging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of others?&rdquo; inquired Comethup, looking round at
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it is not for myself I plead. I do not know,
by the way, that I have ever really pleaded for myself;
your generosity has merely anticipated my necessities.
Mine is a nature which, foolishly enough from the world&rsquo;s
point of view, places self last; it has ever been my way.
But I have taken this journey, on the present occasion,
because I can not see those who are dear to me&mdash;my flesh
and blood, so to speak&mdash;perishing, while the world looks
on with careless eyes. I am a father, and I feel the responsibilities
more than might be imagined. I have
watched my son&rsquo;s career; I have seen men prick their ears
at the mention of his name and nod sagely; I have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup was too impatient to hear more of the preamble.
He seemed to scent disaster in the very air, and
broke in upon the other&rsquo;s slow words impatiently. &ldquo;Yes,
yes; but tell me at once what you mean, why you are here,
and what&rsquo;s happened. Of course, if Brian is in want, you
know that I shall be only too glad to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear nephew, you anticipate my meaning at once.
It is only the truly generous soul that can see deep into
the heart of distress, as it were, in a moment. I will not
disguise from you the fact that these young people, who
have rashly, but with a very beautiful confidence in Providence,
I think, entered upon a union which naturally increases
expenses&mdash;I will not disguise from you the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
that they are in want&mdash;that we all are in want. I&mdash;I have
recently, from motives of economy, taken up my residence
with them, and that close intimacy has enabled me to see
clearly that which my son&rsquo;s natural pride has kept from
my knowledge. Sir, I can bear it no longer. I said to
myself, &lsquo;These young people shall not suffer before my
eyes. I will sacrifice everything for them; I will humble
my pride; I will approach our former benefactor.&rsquo; And
I am here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreadfully sorry to hear what you say,&rdquo; replied
Comethup. &ldquo;Of course I had no idea that Brian would
be in such straits as you describe. I shall be returning
to England within a few days; perhaps I shall be able to
see him. In the meantime, perhaps you will allow me to
give you&mdash;I beg your pardon, lend you&mdash;a sum of money,
and you can then hasten back to them. I trust they are
not&mdash;not in actual want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their credit, up to the moment, has, I rejoice to say,
remained good; but even that is on the point of exhaustion,
and after that&mdash;well, I tremble. So you see, when
it came to a crisis I informed my son that I would seek
you. With the natural hesitation of a proud man, he
refused at first to listen to such a suggestion; but I prevailed,
took sufficient for my journey, on the most economical
principles, and, as I said before, here I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have only a little over thirty pounds with me,&rdquo;
said Comethup, &ldquo;but, as I shall be returning to London
immediately, that will suffice for your present need. You
return to England at once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning,&rdquo; replied Mr. Robert Carlaw,
thrusting the money into his breast pocket. &ldquo;To-night
I shall sleep soundly, for the first time for many weeks;
I do not sleep soundly when I am troubled about those
who are near and dear to me. Yes, I return to-morrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They parted, and Comethup went slowly back to the
hotel. No mention had been made by his aunt about any
probable date of return; they had merely wandered from
city to city as the whim took them, Miss Carlaw having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
always in her mind the desire to teach him forgetfulness.
Therefore, when he went to her that night and stated, with
what carelessness he might, that he should like to return
to London at once, she was naturally somewhat startled.
Even while he was speaking and urging excuses for no
longer remaining abroad she was casting about in her
mind to discover the real reason of this step he contemplated;
she began at last to fear that she understood the
reason only too well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, my dear boy, what ails you? What&rsquo;s the reason
of this sudden change of plan? There&rsquo;s nothing
troubling you, is there? You&rsquo;ve had no&mdash;no letters, no
bad news, to worry you? Won&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To tell her was, of course, impossible. Even if he
could have kept back that former story of all the money
he had paid away, he could not now explain that this girl,
who had left him for another, was in want, and that he,
the man she had cast aside, was to relieve her. That, of
course, could never be explained&mdash;would never be understood.
Although his aunt had scarcely mentioned the
matter to him, he felt, from something she had once said,
that she knew the story of the marriage, and knew that
Brian was &rsquo;Linda&rsquo;s husband. Probably the captain had
told her. But Comethup saw clearly before him that there
was but one course he could adopt&mdash;that of silence. He
could not bear to think that any action of &rsquo;Linda&rsquo;s, or of
those belonging to her, should be misunderstood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course I have had no bad news. What should
make you think that? Only I am a little tired of travelling,
and you know London is always delightful; I&rsquo;ve
heard you say that. My dear aunt, I know you only
undertook this journey because you thought I should like
it. Won&rsquo;t you go back to please me also?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! you&rsquo;re keeping something from me; there&rsquo;s
something hidden away in your heart that you won&rsquo;t tell
me. There! I&rsquo;m not inquisitive&mdash;no more than the rest
of my sex; but I&rsquo;d like to give you a word of warning, boy.
You&rsquo;ve not been happy lately&mdash;oh, I know!&mdash;although you
haven&rsquo;t said a word about it; I&rsquo;m too fond of you not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
notice every little sign. My dear boy, there&rsquo;s something
I never meant to refer to; it&rsquo;s a story that&rsquo;s best left
alone. Comethup, you&rsquo;re not&mdash;not hungering after her
still, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not making this sudden journey to London
after her? Remember, you must put that out of
your mind; I say <i>must</i> advisedly, because there&rsquo;s no other
word to use in the matter. You can&rsquo;t blink the thing
away, my dear: she belongs to some one else, and you&rsquo;ve
done with her. If you don&rsquo;t recognise that, it only means
disaster for both of you. With a man and a woman in
such a situation there are two things for the man to do:
if he can&rsquo;t run away <i>with</i> her, then, by the Lord, he must
run away <i>from</i> her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am not going to London to see her,&rdquo; said Comethup.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re magnifying the matter; she is
married, happily married, and all the other is forgotten
and done with. Won&rsquo;t you understand that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you tell me so. I am very glad, for your sake,
to hear you say it. And, if it pleases you, we&rsquo;ll set off
for London at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One thought was uppermost in Comethup&rsquo;s mind&mdash;that
he must not see &rsquo;Linda. In the first place, he felt
pretty certain that the fact of his having been appealed to
on her own and her husband&rsquo;s behalf had not been revealed
to her; and, in the second, he was not quite sure yet that
he could bear to meet her. That she must, at all costs,
be kept from want and suffering he had fully determined;
all the bright hopes and dreams he had had, even from
his boyhood, concerning her were swept aside and done
with&mdash;things that never had been. The fortune that had
been placed in his hands and which had seemed once so
wonderful was now nothing, save that by its aid, in an
indirect fashion and without her knowledge, he could
benefit her; he was glad to think that he still possessed
that power at least. For his wanderings had not changed
him. Solitary for the most part, except for the companionship
of the strange old woman who loved him and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
have done so much to help him, he had seen, in every
place he visited, the face of the girl always before him;
had gone over, in imagination, words she had spoken to
him; had lived again through scenes of those brief half-happy
weeks in which he had thought she loved him.</p>

<p>Within an hour of reaching London he had set off for
Brian&rsquo;s lodgings; he had found a brief note awaiting him,
giving the address. He discovered it to be in a cheerless
and shabby quarter of town; it was obvious, from the
style of the house, that they had no real home of their
own yet, but were living in furnished apartments. He
wandered up and down the street, in the dusk of the
evening, for a long time, wondering what he should do,
or how it would be possible to meet Brian without also
seeing &rsquo;Linda. He had almost made up his mind, in despair
of anything better, to ring the bell and inquire for
his cousin, when the door of the house he was watching
opened and &rsquo;Linda came out. He was on the opposite
side of the street, standing back in the shadow of a doorway,
and he saw her distinctly&mdash;saw, with something of
a stab at his heart, that she seemed thinner, and that some
of the old elasticity of her step was gone.</p>

<p>He watched her hungrily till she had turned the corner,
and then crossed the road and rang the bell. He was
shown, by a weird-looking, tired-eyed little servant-maid,
into a room on the first floor; it was empty, but in a few
moments a door leading to a farther room was opened
and Brian came in. There was none of the old frank, joyous
fashion of greeting about him; he merely nodded, and
thrust his hands into his pockets and walked across to the
fireplace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;ve found me out at last, have
you? You&rsquo;ve been long enough about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to you as soon as I could,&rdquo; said Comethup.
&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve been abroad, and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abroad! What do you want to fling that in my face
for? Here, some cursed fortune thrusts me, penniless,
into a wretched London lodging-house in a slum, and you
flaunt it in the best hotels all over Europe. Where&rsquo;s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
justice of it? In God&rsquo;s name&rdquo;&mdash;he swung round fiercely,
and made a step toward the other&mdash;&ldquo;how does the world
expect me to work, why does it demand the best of me,
under such circumstances?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be unreasonable,&rdquo; said Comethup slowly. &ldquo;I
met your father in Rome, and sent him hurrying back
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The damned old scoundrel! Do you know that I&rsquo;ve
never even seen him? When I could stand it no longer, I
suggested he should go and find you, and he promised
faithfully to come back the moment&mdash;well, the moment
he got anything. How much did you give him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little over thirty pounds,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a fine time he&rsquo;s having with it, I&rsquo;ll be bound.
Never trust your own flesh and blood, say I. Fancy your
own father leaving you to starve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t trouble about that now,&rdquo; said Comethup.
He had been looking round the shabby room, with
its absence of anything homelike, save for a few flowers
in a cheap vase on a little table and some needlework in
a little basket. He trembled at every footfall on the
stairs, and was only anxious to get away before she returned.
&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve always plenty of money, and
if you will let me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t beat around the bush. What do you suppose
I sent to you for? It&rsquo;s easy enough to come in, well
fed and well dressed&mdash;I&rsquo;ll warrant you drove here in
style&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d say that, if I were you,&rdquo; said Comethup
quietly. His hands were gripped closely behind
him, and one foot was beating restlessly on the carpet.
&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve always been ready to&mdash;to lend you anything
in my power. There&rsquo;s only one thing I&rsquo;d like to say,
and that is, I should be grateful if you wouldn&rsquo;t say anything
about it to any one else&mdash;to &rsquo;Linda, for instance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t fear that; I&rsquo;ve got my pride&mdash;possibly
more of it than you possess. There! I don&rsquo;t want to quarrel
with you; only I suppose I&rsquo;ve got a little soured when
I could see no prospect of anything coming in. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
money does go so devilish fast in London! Why, that
hundred I had&mdash;you remember when I left poor old dad
stranded without a halfpenny&mdash;it&rsquo;s all gone long since.
Poetry is not a paying game, my boy, and these days people
don&rsquo;t seem to believe in a poet who&rsquo;s hidden away in
dingy rooms like this. You see, I can&rsquo;t ask any one to
see me; the people I knew have lost sight of me, and I am
in daily dread of being shelved altogether. A poet must
remember his social duties, like every one else. While I
go on at this rate I shall never make a splash&mdash;never do
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll do well enough in time,&rdquo; said Comethup,
glancing uneasily toward the door. &ldquo;As you want me to
put the thing bluntly,&rdquo; he added with a little laugh, &ldquo;perhaps
I may say that I&rsquo;ve brought some money with me,
and that more shall be forthcoming when that&rsquo;s gone&mdash;until,
of course, you&rsquo;ve been able to make your &lsquo;splash,&rsquo;
as you term it, and can repay it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! of course, that will be all right; it&rsquo;s bound to
come sooner or later. That&rsquo;s just the point; the things
are talked about enough, and if I could once thrust my
head in at society&rsquo;s door and talk about them myself, I
should be a made man. How much can you spare me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t spend much myself, and I thought perhaps&mdash;say
two hundred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, you&rsquo;re a good fellow! Pass it over. I must
trump up a story to &rsquo;Linda about a sudden remittance
from the publishers; women like to know the ins and outs
of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is she well?&rdquo; asked Comethup carelessly, as he
held out the notes to the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she&rsquo;s well enough,&rdquo; replied Brian. &ldquo;Like
most of her delightful sex, she&rsquo;s possessed of a temper,
and so am I, so that we don&rsquo;t always pull together nicely
in harness. But she&rsquo;s very fond of me, and I&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;m
very fond of her. But, I say, you&rsquo;d better be going, hadn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; replied Comethup. He picked
up his hat, and looked for a moment round the room;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
he did not know when, if ever, he should see it again, and
it was a wonderful place to him, poor though it was, because
she lived there.</p>

<p>Brian went to the door, to ascertain if the coast was
clear, and Comethup, shaking him hurriedly by the hand,
ran downstairs and got into the street. Even then for
a long time he could not leave the place, lingering unhappily
up and down on the other side of the street,
waiting to catch a glimpse of her again.</p>

<p>He saw her come back presently and enter the house,
saw lights gleam in the room he had left, and a little
later still saw them both come out and the girl link her
arm in Brian&rsquo;s, and watched them go off together in high
spirits. Walking sadly a long way behind them, he saw
Brian hail a cab at the end of the street and put her in
and jump in himself; saw the cab drive away westward.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="subheading">A SECOND DESERTION.</p>


<p>Now that they were once again established in London,
Miss Charlotte Carlaw made up her mind that they would
entertain and be entertained; that the Prince Charming,
who had burst, so to speak, upon her acquaintances as a
mere child, should, now that his education and his travels
were completed, appear before them as a man. She set
about the business with characteristic energy. He was
regarded, as he had always been, as the head of the house,
and, although Miss Charlotte Carlaw very rarely went out,
Comethup knew that it pleased her that he should accept
invitations, even though his doing so must leave her alone.
So it happened that he went about a great deal.</p>

<p>It was at a big house one night in the following year
that he met &rsquo;Linda. It was the house of a woman who
liked to call about her every little shining light, in whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
particular sphere they might be, and make much of
them for a while, and then drop them as hurriedly. Comethup
had seen Brian at the end of one of the rooms, with
a group about him; had had time to notice, as he passed
unobserved, that Brian was talking at a great rate, and
looking handsomer than ever. Several women were in the
group, and he heard their bright laughter as he passed.</p>

<p>Quite alone in an alcove he stumbled suddenly upon
the girl. It was the first time they had met since that
night in the old garden, which now seemed so many miles
away. She was very simply but very beautifully dressed.
As she glanced up at him, with almost a frightened look,
he overcame his momentary hesitation, held out his
hand quite naturally, and smiled as she had seen him smile
when a boy. He thought her glance changed almost to
one of gratitude; he sat beside her and tried to get some
natural phrase to his lips, and to still the heavy beating
of his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I saw Brian&mdash;just now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had no idea
you would be here, although I might have known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m not so lucky as Brian; he seems to
know every one, or else they want to know him, and I
get left a little out in the cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shame,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re in
the same boat; no one wants to have much to do with a
dull fellow like me. So it&rsquo;s rather lucky I came across
you, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded slowly; her head was bowed a little, so
that he could scarcely see her face. Presently, when she
raised it and looked at him, it shook him to the depths
to see that her eyes were full of tears. &ldquo;Have you nothing
to say to me?&rdquo; she asked, in a low voice. &ldquo;Oh! forgive
me. I ought not to have said that; but it seems so
hard to sit here and talk commonplaces, as though we had
just been introduced&mdash;so hard, when I remember all that&mdash;all
that has gone before. Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been kinder
if you had walked past me just now, without knowing
me? I should have deserved that; this hurts me a thousand
times more.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I behave to you like that?&rdquo; he asked,
with a smile. &ldquo;If we must go back to that old story, for
Heaven&rsquo;s sake let us look on the best side of it! If any
one is to blame about the matter, I am the sinner. I like
best&mdash;you won&rsquo;t mind my saying this, I am sure!&mdash;I like
best to think of all the splendid times we had, when we
were little mites, with the captain, you know; and I like
to think, if that will please you, that, when we got a little
older&mdash;well, we played at love, as we played at so many
things before, although the captain didn&rsquo;t help us there,
did he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up at him quickly, with the ghost of a smile
flitting across her face, and made a movement as though
she would have stretched out her hand to him. But she
stopped, and he went on again more easily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So now, you see, the game is ended, as so many
other games we played ended in their good time. Let
that suffice. It&rsquo;s good to see you again, and to know that
you are happy, and that all things are going well with you,
little friend. Come, tell me about yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and held each other&rsquo;s for one long
moment; then he turned his away. Perhaps in that look
she understood, in a dim fashion, for the first time, all
that this man had lost, all that she had snatched from
him; perchance she saw something greater here than had
before touched her life. But, moving to his mood, she
began to talk quickly, almost gaily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Brian is doing splendidly, and making heaps
of money. You know we&rsquo;ve left the first place in which
we lived long ago, and have got a beautiful little house
in Chelsea&mdash;you&rsquo;ll come and see us, won&rsquo;t you?&mdash;and a
great many clever people come there to see him, and then
we go out a great deal. Oh, you&rsquo;ve no idea how different
it all seems from the quiet old days before&mdash;before I
was married. But I suspect you&rsquo;ve heard how well Brian
is getting on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had heard it, indeed. Sitting beside her there,
he wondered what she would have thought if she had
known that the little house in Chelsea, the full, ever-varying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
life she led, the very dress that brushed against him,
were all purchased with his money. He wondered what
she would have thought had she known that this husband
of hers swept gaily along the pathway of life which
Comethup cleared for him, coming without the faintest
hesitation, again and again, to his cousin when former
supplies were exhausted, never stopping for an instant to
consider the justice or the injustice of the matter, but
taking everything as his right, almost without thanks;
whining about his hard lot, or railing at Fate, according
as the mood was with him, yet living always at the fullest
pressure, with not even a passing thought for the morrow.
For one brief moment, perhaps, a perfectly natural
thought flashed into his mind to tell her, to let her see
clearly the shame of the thing, to understand what this
man she loved really was. But the thought was gone
almost before it had entered his mind, and he felt himself
flushing angrily that it should ever have been there at all.
Instead, he looked round at her, and answered her question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ve heard all about it, and I&rsquo;m very glad
for your sake. I suppose Brian is working very hard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very hard just now. He tells me that in his
profession he has to look out always for fresh ideas, that
unless he meets a great many people and sees a great
many different phases of life he can&rsquo;t expect to give expression
to the best that&rsquo;s in him. That&rsquo;s what he says;
I dare say you know what he means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I know what he means,&rdquo; said Comethup
slowly. &ldquo;I suppose one mustn&rsquo;t judge a poet by ordinary
standards. You see, I&rsquo;m such an idle dog, and I just
manage to stroll through life in&mdash;in the sunshine, and so
I don&rsquo;t quite understand what that other life&mdash;the life of
a genius&mdash;means. By the way, I&rsquo;m thinking of going
down to see the captain; have you any message for him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face was turned away; she did not answer for a
moment. &ldquo;What does he think of me?&rdquo; she asked at last,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but the best, I can assure you,&rdquo; he replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been, and always will be, his little &rsquo;Linda,
the child he knew so many years ago. Why should he
think badly of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re quite sure&mdash;well, give him my love; say
that I think of him often and often; that in moments
when I am alone I dream that I am in his garden again,
among the roses; that I am still a little child, with my
arms about him. And say&mdash;say that I am quite, quite
happy. Will you remember that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every word,&rdquo; said Comethup. He felt he could not
trust himself to say anything more, or even to look into
her eyes again; he got up and said hurriedly and awkwardly
that he supposed he should see her again, and so
left her. The rooms were very full, and Brian was talking
away to a new group as Comethup got out of the
place and went into the street.</p>

<p>All the misery was back upon him in fullest strength;
all the old unsatisfied longings, the dreams he had
dreamed, the hopes he had cherished, had swept down upon
him like a flood with the touch of her hand, the glance
of her eyes. It had not seemed so bitter a thing when he
had merely to think of her, to picture her in this situation
or in that in a wholly intangible form; to see her
face to face was a different matter, needing a stronger
courage. He asked himself, again and again, that question
which is inevitable in some men&rsquo;s lives: why Fate
had given him so much, and yet stripped away from him
that which was worth more than all he had received. Yet,
through it all, she stood out as some one far above him;
some one he had loved, in a foolish, vain fashion, in some
far-off time, without any hope that she could love him in
return. Whichever way his thoughts turned and returned,
and swept hither and thither, there was not anywhere
any blame for her.</p>

<p>He could not sleep that night; he paced his room hour
after hour, turning old forgotten things over in his mind&mdash;things
which would have been so much better left alone.
He was roused after a little time by a light tap at the
door, and Miss Charlotte Carlaw came in, a strange-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
figure, with a dressing-gown wrapped about her and
a shawl thrown over her head. He stood still, and she
came slowly across to him and fumbled for his hands and
took them. &ldquo;My boy, my boy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what has happened?
what is wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not answer; he drew her arm through his, and
they began to walk up and down the room together, she
with one hand gently touching his arm as if to soothe him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreams, dreams, dreams!&rdquo; he broke out at last.
&ldquo;Oh! if a man might sleep soundly and forget everything
that&rsquo;s gone, forget words that were uttered, and the
clasp of hands that have touched his, and&mdash;and other
things besides!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s something,
God or devil, I don&rsquo;t know which it is, that won&rsquo;t
let us forget anything. The best and the worst of us,
boy, have had to go through it, and I think we come in
time to find that we&rsquo;re glad we can&rsquo;t forget, however
bitter the remembrance may have been at first. The years
soften things, dear, and show them in a better and a kindlier
light, and we learn our difficult lesson with many
tears and much smudging of the slate of life; but we
learn it all the same, and we grow to laugh at the end,
when the lessons are put away and the long day is finished.
You haven&rsquo;t learned that yet, Comethup, and you
don&rsquo;t think now you can; but you will, Heaven knows you
will&mdash;Have you seen her again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you talked with her, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Oh, forgive me; it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter so
much before, but now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she happy?&rdquo; asked the old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she seems very happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well; that&rsquo;s better than I expected. Come,
boy, I don&rsquo;t want to preach to you; I am something of
a blundering old sinner myself&mdash;I&rsquo;m the last person to
preach to any one. But I know something of what life
is, and I&rsquo;ve learned the best way to get through it. I
suppose you&rsquo;ll be bound to meet her sometimes; that&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
the sort of devilish game Fate plays with us. The things
we most want to see are kept out of our sight, and those
we would be glad to avoid are thrust under our very
noses. But don&rsquo;t see her more than you can help, and
try to think&mdash;it&rsquo;s a bit hard to do so, I admit&mdash;but try
to think that the world holds something else than one
woman, and something better than dreams and regrets.
Face it, boy. Move about and see people and interest
yourself in other matters. I won&rsquo;t do you the injustice
to say that you will be able to forget; I&rsquo;m afraid you
won&rsquo;t do that. But at least you&rsquo;ll grow to look at the
matter in a different way, and to think it wasn&rsquo;t so bad
after all; I&rsquo;m quite sure you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They paced up and down the room together for a little
time longer, Miss Carlaw occasionally drawing his hand
up to her lips or against her cheek, and sometimes softly
crooning a few bars of an old song, as though to a child
in pain or trouble. Presently, quite briskly, she took
him by the shoulders, and drew his head down that she
might kiss him, and felt her way out of the room. And,
after a time, he crept to bed and slept more soundly than
he had hoped to do.</p>

<p>A couple of days after that he went down to see the
captain. It was his first visit since the night of &rsquo;Linda&rsquo;s
flight, and he almost feared on his journey down that the
captain might refer to the matter in some way and tear
wider the old wound. But he might have known the
little gentleman better, for no word was said on the subject
during the whole of his stay, which lasted some days.
With a melancholy desire, however to reopen the wound
himself, Comethup let his feet stray one night, soon
after his arrival in the old town, toward the neglected
garden of the house in which she had lived&mdash;it seemed so
much easier to think there, even to think calmly, than in
any other place.</p>

<p>There seemed always to be dead and drifting leaves in
that garden, at whatever time of the year; a different
atmosphere was there from that found anywhere else. He
walked all round the house, lingering among the trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
as he had lingered when a boy, almost thinking he saw
sometimes the flutter of her childish frock going on
before him. The place seemed deserted; not a light
gleamed from any window.</p>

<p>At last he became conscious that there really was
some one moving before him in the garden, flitting about
among the trees, gliding into shadows, and keeping as
much as possible out of sight. The place had seemed
ghostly enough before, but now a little chill fear crept
into his heart and stopped his feet; immediately the
movement among the trees ceased also.</p>

<p>In some alarm Comethup, with a hasty glance behind
him, called out hurriedly to know who was there. The
movement began again, and a figure came slowly from
between the trees and approached him in a sidelong, hesitating
fashion. Comethup, summoning his courage, made
a hasty step forward and was confronted by old Medmer
Theed, the shoemaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how you startled me!&rdquo; exclaimed the young
man. &ldquo;Why are you dodging and hiding among the trees
like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man came nearer to him and laid a thin,
knotted hand on his arm. &ldquo;To watch for her, to wait for
her,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;See&rdquo;&mdash;he waved his other hand
toward the dark old house&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s all silent and empty
now, nothing to be seen. But she&rsquo;ll come back, she&rsquo;ll
come back&mdash;just as the other child might have come; I
wait for her as I waited for the other. But all my dreams
have confused me. I don&rsquo;t know which is alive and
which is dead, or whether both are alive or both dead,
or whether there was only one, after all. But she&rsquo;ll come
back, and so I wait for her. Sometimes I dream that she
has come back already, after I&rsquo;ve gone to my bed; and I
wake with a start, thinking I hear her knocking, knocking
at the door. But there&rsquo;s no one there and the street is
empty. But she&rsquo;ll come back here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why should she come back?&rdquo; asked Comethup
sadly. &ldquo;She is in London with her husband, happily
married. Didn&rsquo;t you know that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man laughed a little scornfully. &ldquo;Happily
married!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Does a child weep when it is
happy? are there tears in a woman&rsquo;s eyes when all is
well with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, sometimes,&rdquo; replied Comethup.
&ldquo;But why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen. She was sent to me as a tiny child, straight
from the arms of God, to comfort me when&mdash;when all
my dreams were wrong. I have watched her grow up;
have seen the sunlight gladly follow her across the doorway
and across the floor of my shop when she flitted in&mdash;brighter
than any sunlight&mdash;and sat beside me. The time
came when she came to me less and less often; when she
would only flit in sometimes, bringing the sunlight, and
put her arms about my neck and her cheek against mine,
and whisper a word or two and run away again. But I
loved her&mdash;she was sent to me, she belonged to me.
Mine was the charge to watch over her, and I watched for
a long, long time. I saw her grow to girlhood; I saw
her become a woman&mdash;just as the other had grown; and
then began the time when I must watch her indeed. I
have lain here among the trees many and many a night,
only that I might see the light burning calmly in her
window. And then the time came when I saw something
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Comethup in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw <i>him</i> come&mdash;come like a thief in the night,
calling softly to her; whispering softly, with his arms
about her. See&rdquo;&mdash;he stretched out his arms and shook
them stiff and hard before Comethup&mdash;&ldquo;I am strong;
much labour has made me strong. I wish now that I had
caught him by his white throat and turned his smiling
face up to the stars and held him so until he died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For shame!&rdquo; cried Comethup. &ldquo;Why should you
kill him? She loved him, and they are married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was because I thought she loved him that
I hesitated,&rdquo; whispered the old man, dropping his hands
to his sides. &ldquo;And yet she came always as though with
her love there was half a fear of him, as though he smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
and beckoned to her and drew her against her will. He
didn&rsquo;t love her, and she will come back here; she will be
glad to come back. And so I watch for her night after
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without any further words he slipped away again
among the trees and was soon lost to sight. Comethup
hesitated a moment, but feeling it would be useless to
go after him or to argue further with him, he went out
of the garden and took his way back to the captain&rsquo;s.
Another thought had occurred to him in regard to the old
house, and he mentioned the matter to the captain that
night as they sat together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you remember a
woman&mdash;a Mrs. Dawson, I think&mdash;who used to live with&mdash;with
&rsquo;Linda at her father&rsquo;s old house! What has become
of her? I noticed to-night,&rdquo; he added, with what
carelessness he might, &ldquo;that the place appears to be shut
up and empty; I happened to pass that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain looked at him keenly and sympathetically
for a moment. &ldquo;She has gone away,&rdquo; he said at last.
&ldquo;She came to me immediately before leaving here; she
seemed to know no one in the place except myself, and
she had a vague idea that I had been kind to &rsquo;Linda in
some way, and that it was necessary for her to thank me.
In her agitation she let fall a remark which led me to
question her; and I heard for the first time her melancholy
history. As we are all interested, my dear boy, in
anything that touches our little friend &rsquo;Linda, you might
as well know it; although, for that matter, we are neither
of us likely to see the woman again, and it will be better&mdash;in
fact, it was her wish&mdash;that &rsquo;Linda should know nothing
about it. It seems that this woman, who was known
merely as Mrs. Dawson, was really &rsquo;Linda&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her mother!&rdquo; echoed Comethup. &ldquo;But why was
the matter kept secret, and why did she masquerade under
another name and in the capacity of a dependent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon after her marriage it appears that she fled with
a lover, leaving the child behind. From what I once saw
of Dr. Vernier, I am not very much disposed to lay any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
heavy sentence upon her; besides, God forbid that I
should judge any human creature, especially a woman!
However, the lover died, and the mother traced her husband
out and begged that she might see her child. With
a cruelty which one can scarcely understand, he permitted
her to remain in the house with the child strictly
on the understanding that her identity was not to be revealed.
To that stipulation she seems loyally to have
conformed. Of course, as you may readily suppose, when
the girl had grown up and her father was dead, the
wretched mother naturally shrank from telling her daughter
the shameful story, and lived on as before. Now, of
course, in a moment her child is swept away from her
and she can do nothing. In fact, rightly or wrongly, I
advised her for &rsquo;Linda&rsquo;s sake to say nothing. And where
she has gone I really don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pitiful story,&rdquo; said Comethup after a pause. &ldquo;We
have, as you say, to think of the girl and of her new position;
she has gone out of this woman&rsquo;s life, and I suppose&mdash;well,
it seems rather hard, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so hard as it might have been. She believes
that her daughter is happily married, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believes!&rdquo; echoed Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon; I should have said she knows she
is happily married. And that is something of a comfort
to her. I think she despaired long since of ever being
able to reveal herself to her daughter. And you think
that our little &rsquo;Linda is really happy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course she is. She married the man she
loved,&rdquo; said Comethup quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose she did,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;And
Brian, I understand, is doing well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he&rsquo;s doing well enough,&rdquo; replied Comethup,
turning away.</p>

<p>He wandered again in the garden of her old house the
next night. Medmer Theed may have been lurking
among the trees, but he did not see him. Coming out,
when it was very late, into the street, he found the old
captain pacing up and down before the gate, with his long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
military cloak about him, and his hands clasped under it
behind his back. They walked on slowly down the road
together. It seemed almost a natural thing that he
should be there, and for some time Comethup said nothing.
At last, looking round, he said slowly, &ldquo;I suppose
you think I&rsquo;m a fool, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; said the old man, staring straight in
front of him as he walked. &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s got to fight this
sort of thing out alone, and with what strength God may
give him. Come home, boy; to-morrow&mdash;oh, it hurts me
to part from you&mdash;but to-morrow you must go to London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think you&rsquo;re right. All this place is full of
memories of her; I hear her voice&mdash;as child or woman&mdash;wherever
I turn; her light feet tread all the road beside
me where I walk; the very moon shines as calmly down
upon me as when we walked together&mdash;lovers. Don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;m saying anything against her; perhaps I&rsquo;ve even
been coward enough to hug my pain a little, because the
pain has been so sweet. Give me your hand, old friend;
I promise&mdash;there, I&rsquo;ll swear if you like&mdash;that I&rsquo;ll try to
put it all aside. I can&rsquo;t forget it; that&rsquo;s quite another
matter; but I&rsquo;ll put it away from me and be a little
braver about it. There&rsquo;s my hand on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; said the captain, gripping his hand.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to send you away, but I think you know it&rsquo;s
best, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. I must find some work to do; I
have been an idle dog too long. Come, let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet even in London he could not keep away from her;
he thought of her when he woke in the morning, and
breathed her name when he lay down to rest at night.
He found his way one night to the little house they had
taken in Chelsea; longed to go in, in a natural fashion,
yet dared not trust himself. Once or twice he turned
resolutely to go away, and then came back again, and lingered
still. At last, when it was getting late, the door
was opened and he saw, from his position on the opposite
side of the street, his Uncle Robert Carlaw standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
within the hall, lighting a cigar; saw him set his hat at
the proper angle, and come swinging out into the street.
Comethup had no particular wish to meet him, and only
wondered a little, in his own mind, under what circumstances
he had returned to his son&rsquo;s house. He was just
walking away in good earnest, when Mr. Robert Carlaw
crossed the street, recognised him, and came breathlessly
after him. Comethup faced about and pretended not to
notice the other&rsquo;s outstretched hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! my dear boy, I see we do not meet on the old
cordial footing. Well, it has been my fate through life
to be misjudged; to be met with scorn when I craved only
sympathy; to have every action of mine misunderstood,
every word misinterpreted. Don&rsquo;t turn away from me, I
beg; let me explain, let me appeal to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup had stopped, and stood looking at him
coldly. &ldquo;There certainly seems to be the need for some
explanation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose you will not deny that
you deceived me; that the money I placed in your hands,
at your request, to help Brian and&mdash;and his wife, never
reached them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear nephew, a moment; I crave only a moment.
I left you that night in Rome, with the full intention of
returning to them and flinging the whole before them and
crying: &lsquo;See! the wolf is no longer at the door; your
father has saved you!&rsquo; That was my full intention. But
alas! I was tempted; tempted not for my own sake, but
for theirs. The money was but a small amount&mdash;you
will admit it was small, my dear nephew&mdash;and I saw
the opportunity to increase it. I turned aside on my
journey at one of those gambling hells which should, if
I had my way, be swept off the face of Europe to-morrow;
I turned aside and staked that small sum for them. I
felt that I might be able to take them perhaps ten times
the amount. But, alas! I lost all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you might have expected,&rdquo; said Comethup.
&ldquo;Fortunately for them, I returned within a day or two
after you, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I have heard, so I have heard,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Robert Carlaw. &ldquo;Bless you, my young friend, bless you!
For myself, how I contrived to reach London I scarcely
know; but I <i>did</i> reach it, and after some weeks of fear
and trembling I at last approached my son and threw myself
upon his mercy. I&mdash;in fact, we are quite reconciled,
and I have taken up my abode with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I observe,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to-night, sir, to-night even that must cease.
The crowning piece of ingratitude has at last been
reached; the son for whom I have done so much, sacrificed
so much&mdash;the son of whom I have been, as I felt, justly
proud&mdash;has deserted me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deserted you?&rdquo; cried Comethup, catching his arm.
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone, sir&mdash;fled! He has lulled me into a feeling of
false security; led me to believe that I could end my days
in the bosom of his family, surrounded by men of culture
and refinement, who would naturally appeal to those
finer instincts in me which have had so long to remain
dormant, and then in a moment he has gone and ruined
my prospects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the devil don&rsquo;t you speak plainly?&rdquo; cried Comethup,
roused at last, and shaking him fiercely by the
arm. &ldquo;What do you mean? Do you mean that he has
deserted his wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only has he deserted her, my dear nephew, but
he has had the audacity to leave her to my care&rdquo;&mdash;he
struck himself on the breast&mdash;&ldquo;to <i>my</i> care&mdash;an old man
who has toiled for him through a long and cheerless life,
and who might, but for the ingratitude of him and others,
have been something of a figure in the world. But he has
reckoned, sir, without knowing what I really am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Comethup slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean, my dear nephew, that that is a game at
which two can play. Does he think that a man of my
position is to be left to starve with a mere chit of a girl?
No, sir; he took this responsibility upon himself, and it
has nothing to do with me. I absolutely refuse to accept
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>Comethup took him suddenly by the shoulders and
looked steadily into his eyes; Mr. Robert Carlaw&rsquo;s eyes
shifted a little before the steady gaze of the other. &ldquo;Do
you mean to say that you&rsquo;re going to desert her too, eh?&rdquo;
asked Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear nephew, there&rsquo;s no question of desertion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer me, yes or no. I didn&rsquo;t want to talk about
it, but you may perhaps remember that you&rsquo;ve depended
upon me for some years past. Leave her now, and, as
surely as there&rsquo;s a God above us, I&rsquo;ll leave you to starve!
Now, how&rsquo;s it to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear nephew, think of the position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear uncle, I have thought of the position.
When did Brian go, and where has he gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe he has gone to Paris, and, as generally
happens in such cases, there&rsquo;s a woman in the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup nodded grimly and glanced across at the
house which Mr. Robert Carlaw had just left; he seemed
to mutter something between his teeth. &ldquo;To Paris.
Well, I dare say I can find him. In the meantime you
go back and you stay with her. Does she know anything
about this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, if there&rsquo;s one thing I dislike more than
another, it&rsquo;s a scene with a woman&mdash;tears, and all that
kind of thing. As that scapegrace son of mine had not
seen fit to mention the matter, I thought it scarcely devolved
upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; replied Comethup. &ldquo;And so you were going
to creep out and leave her there&mdash;alone in uncertainty&mdash;to
starve, for aught that you cared! Now, go
back to her. Tell her nothing about this, except that
Brian has been called away on business; I dare say your
conscience will stretch to the extent of that lie. As regards
pecuniary matters, I think you know you may
safely leave them with me; but about that you will say
nothing to her. For the rest I pledge you my word that
if I can find Brian he shall be back here within a week.
Now, go back to her, and hold your tongue!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw commenced a protest, at first with
something of bluster and then whiningly; but Comethup
pointed sternly to the house, and at last, with a shrug of
his shoulders, the uncle turned away and left the nephew
standing looking after him. In a moment, however, he
came rapidly back again. &ldquo;My dear boy!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;you won&rsquo;t leave us in the lurch? There are, of course,
things to pay, and&mdash;and a position to be kept up, and
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave you in the lurch; you may be sure of
that. Go back to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He watched Mr. Robert Carlaw re-enter the house,
and then turned away and walked homeward with a rapid
step.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="subheading">COMETHUP DRIVES A BARGAIN.</p>


<p>It scarcely occurred to Comethup until after he had
started on his chase what a mad business it all really
was. He was in a mood more than once to turn back,
to let this cousin take his own path; the feverish desire
was upon him to be with &rsquo;Linda&mdash;even, perhaps, by reason
of the other&rsquo;s desertion, to creep a little nearer into her
life. But that thought was a blasphemy. After all, this
man who had left her was the one man she loved, the one
man she ever would love; if Comethup would play the
part he had set himself, the part of loyal friend, he must
bring that man back.</p>

<p>He had made a careless, half-jesting excuse to his
aunt, and had stated that he would be back again within
a few days. And now, in Paris, he wondered how he
should set about his quest, or in what quarter of the city
he should discover the runaway. He had no clew. Brian
knew Paris well, and it was impossible to say where he
would take up his abode, especially if, as his father had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
hinted, he had a companion. However, the search had
to be made, and it was begun within an hour of Comethup&rsquo;s
arrival in the city.</p>

<p>For two long days and nights he scarcely rested, going
to every place of amusement, from the highest to the
lowest; scanning the faces of people who passed him
in the streets; standing at the doors of theatres and
dancing-halls, and watching every one wherever the life
of the city beat most thick and fast. And at last his
patience was rewarded.</p>

<p>He was sitting in a <i>café</i> late on the afternoon of the
third day, miserably turning over the matter in his mind
and almost giving up the business as hopeless; he had a
paper in his hand, but had not read a line of it. Suddenly,
from the street where the lamps were beginning to
gleam, Brian Carlaw came swinging in and took a seat
near the door. Comethup raised the paper so as to hide
his own face, and peered round it at his cousin. He was
glad, for one thing, to find him alone; but he felt that it
would be impossible to broach the subject in a public
place, or even to confront him. For the present he must
merely watch and be careful that his quarry did not again
escape him.</p>

<p>Brian proved to be in a restless mood. After but a few
minutes, and when he had only half consumed the refreshment
he had ordered, he looked at his watch and got
up and went out. Comethup dropped the paper, and followed
him. Brian walked rapidly, evidently having a
settled destination in view; at last he turned in at the
door of a small hotel in a side street, and the door closed
behind him.</p>

<p>Comethup waited for some moments and then followed
him; discovered from the servant the number of
Brian&rsquo;s room, and ran up the stairs. Without pause of
any kind he knocked sharply at the door, turned the
handle, and went in. His cousin had divested himself of
his coat and waistcoat, and was evidently preparing to
dress for the evening; he turned round quickly on hearing
the movement at the door, and looked in astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
at his visitor. Then gradually a smile stole
over his face, and he cried out to Comethup with great
cordiality:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear boy, what on earth does this mean?
How did you discover me? I thought I was hidden from
all the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Comethup, &ldquo;I suppose you did. I have
been searching for you for nearly three days. I followed
you home just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in his voice caused Brian&rsquo;s face to change;
the mirthful light went out of it, and his lips, so pleasantly
smiling a moment before, became a hard, thin line.
He advanced a little from the dressing table where he had
been standing, and looked at the other with a frown.
&ldquo;What the devil should you follow me for? What do
you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup backed away to the door, turned the key
in the lock, and dropped the key in his pocket. His
voice was very cool and steady when he spoke, only in
his own ears it sounded as though some one else were
speaking far away. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I want to say to
you&mdash;something that must be said now. Are you listening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn your impudence!&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;You
were always a crack-brained fellow. What&rsquo;s your game
now, that you force your way into my room like this and
lock me in? Do you want to murder me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not quite sure,&rdquo; said Comethup, with a strange
little laugh. &ldquo;It might come to that, perhaps; it depends
upon yourself&mdash;Come away from that bell&rdquo;&mdash;for
Brian had made a dash at the white electric button in
the wall&mdash;&ldquo;or, by God, I&rsquo;ll strangle you before any one
can get this door open! And I&rsquo;m a stronger man than
you are; I&rsquo;ve had a better training.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian came back to the dressing table in a sidelong,
furtive fashion, watching Comethup narrowly. &ldquo;Well,
what do you wish? I don&rsquo;t want to have a scene, and I
may tell you that I have no time to waste. I&rsquo;m going
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Comethup. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lots of time
before we catch the night train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The night train!&rdquo; echoed Brian. &ldquo;What the devil
do I want with the night train?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To take you back to London,&rdquo; said Comethup calmly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to explain, and it will be well for
you to listen quietly. I know that it&rsquo;s quite useless to
appeal to you; I&rsquo;ve learned that long since. So now I&rsquo;ll
put it more brutally, and tell you what you <i>must</i> do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Brian sneeringly; &ldquo;when one deals with
a madman I suppose the best way is to humour him; at
least I&rsquo;ve always been told so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to say anything about myself; that
would be rather out of place,&rdquo; began Comethup in his
slow, soft voice. &ldquo;But I want to speak of some one else&mdash;of
your wife. I heard, quite by accident, that you had
deserted her; left her, for aught that you cared, to starve;
that you had come here after another woman. I suppose
you won&rsquo;t&mdash;won&rsquo;t think it worth while to deny all that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I? You seem to have got the story
pretty accurately. What&rsquo;s it to do with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; replied Comethup. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what has
brought me here. You don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;d be racing about
Paris for two or three days after <i>you</i> for the pleasure of
the thing, do you? I said I wasn&rsquo;t going to speak about
myself, but I find I must. This girl, &rsquo;Linda, the sweetest
and brightest it was ever a man&rsquo;s good fortune to
win&mdash;this girl loves you; would give, I think, her immortal
soul for you. Yet, at a whim, a caprice, you fling
her aside, careless whether you break her heart, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Break her heart! Hearts are not so easily broken;
even I can tell you that, although I am a poet. Besides,
what the devil&rsquo;s her heart got to do with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than you can understand. I think I&rsquo;d give
everything I have in the world to spare her any pain.
I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t understand what that feeling is.
I&rsquo;d give my very soul to save her from tears or sorrow,
to prevent any one of her ideals from being shattered. If
I could die and know that in dying I gave her any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
greater happiness&mdash;well, my life wouldn&rsquo;t be worth an
hour&rsquo;s purchase from this moment&mdash;Oh, I forgot; you
don&rsquo;t understand all that. But there&rsquo;s one thing you
shall understand: you&rsquo;re going back with me to London
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed? You seem to have made up your mind
about that. If you take so deep an interest in &rsquo;Linda, why
the devil don&rsquo;t you let me go my own way and&mdash;well, look
after her yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were nothing; it was the horrible smile that
played about Brian&rsquo;s lips&mdash;the sneering suggestion that
he knew of the love in the other man&rsquo;s mind, and triumphed
in the knowledge; it was all this that maddened
Comethup. With a cry he threw himself upon the other
and forced him to his knees, and kept a grip upon his
throat sufficient to stifle the life out of him had he kept
it there long. &ldquo;You coward! I&rsquo;ve bandied words with
you too long; I&rsquo;ve told you things that are as far from
your ken as the knowledge of the stars. Get up&rdquo;&mdash;he
dragged him to his feet and flung him off&mdash;&ldquo;and get on
that coat! I&rsquo;ll waste no more time in talking. I won&rsquo;t
lose sight of you until I see you in your own home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and if I refuse?&rdquo; said Brian sullenly, glaring
at the other like a creature at bay.</p>

<p>Comethup laughed quietly and glanced round the
room; buttoned his coat swiftly and came at his cousin
slowly, steadily, without once taking his eyes from the
eyes that shifted uneasily before his. &ldquo;Why, if you refuse,
I&rsquo;ll kill you! Don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a threat merely;
we&rsquo;re near the top of this house, and I can choke the life
out of you long before any one breaks in this door, or
even before you can give the alarm. Understand&mdash;I&rsquo;m
desperate; I&rsquo;ve staked everything on this, and I won&rsquo;t
hesitate. Now, as we stand man to man, I&rsquo;ll tell you
what you may have guessed before. I love your wife;
to me she&rsquo;s higher even than the angels. And my love
has this quality&mdash;that life and death and heaven and hell
are nothing, mere words, compared with my love for her,
compared to what that love would make me do. It&rsquo;s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
madness, isn&rsquo;t it, friend Brian, that a man may love a
woman so well that he would kill another man rather
than see her trust in that other betrayed? She thinks
nothing of me. How should she? If I killed you, she
would never cease to revile my memory and hold you up
as a martyr; there&rsquo;s where the madness comes in. But
that would be best for her, better than that she should
find you out. Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian looked at him curiously for a few moments and
then began to laugh in a foolish, half-nervous fashion, as
though he had suddenly been confronted with something
he did not understand, and scarcely knew what attitude to
take toward it. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re more mad than I thought
you were,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Suppose I go back to London,
do you think I&rsquo;m going to settle down in that dull
house all my days? I tell you I&rsquo;m made of different stuff.
I want life, movement, music, laughter about me; a dull
old dog like you can&rsquo;t understand that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have them all,&rdquo; said Comethup eagerly.
&ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll make no one-sided bargain; let&rsquo;s understand
one another. I&rsquo;ve shown you my hand, shown you the
reason for this thing I&rsquo;m doing. Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m doing
it for your sake; you needn&rsquo;t flatter yourself to that extent.
In all these things I put her first&mdash;her happiness
is the great thing. Now, if I ask you to take up again a
life which you say is distasteful, I&rsquo;ll take upon myself to
make it sweet. You shall have what money you want;
I have a large income now, and when&mdash;God forgive the
thought, but you force me to say it&mdash;when my aunt dies
I shall be a very rich man. If you do this thing, I swear
to you you shall never need money; that&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s in my
power to do, as a complete outsider, for the woman I love.
She won&rsquo;t ever know it, and you&mdash;well, you can keep her
happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I can do that,&rdquo; said the other easily. &ldquo;You
talk of your love for her; you know you might strive all
your days, you poor beggar, and never come nearer her
heart; might spend every farthing you have in the world
on her, and she would scarcely feel grateful to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve got the pull of you. She&rsquo;s grateful to
me if she can win a smile from me at any hour of the
day; she&rsquo;s so wrapped up in me that the simple words
&lsquo;my dear,&rsquo; flung carelessly to her, are more to her than
the most impassioned love-speech could be from you or
any one else. I don&rsquo;t know what it is&rdquo;&mdash;he went on
with a laugh, tossing his hair back from his forehead&mdash;&ldquo;but
I have that power over women; I may even flout and
insult them, and, by God! I think they like me the better
for it.&mdash;Well, I don&rsquo;t see the fun of risking starvation if
it can be avoided, and, after all, you&rsquo;re pretty safe. I&rsquo;ll
go back to London; but mind, I hold you to your word.
If you care so much for her happiness, by the Lord, you
shall pay for it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you what you like,&rdquo; said Comethup quietly.
&ldquo;But one word more: what brought you over here?
Who&rsquo;s the woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a dear old moralist you are!&rdquo; exclaimed Brian,
laughing. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re afraid I may be deserting
some one else, eh? Well, let me tell you for your comfort
that she&rsquo;s rich; that she&rsquo;s taken a fancy to me, held
up a beckoning finger, and I&mdash;well, I followed. I dare
say she&rsquo;d have dropped me in a month or two, when she
found that her poet was like most other men, so perhaps
it&rsquo;s as well that you&rsquo;ve rescued me. And, when I come
to think of it, it will be quite in keeping with my character
that I should rush away at a moment&rsquo;s notice, without
even an apology. You see, we poor devils are always
supposed to do the most unexpected things&mdash;never anything
proper or regular, you know. Upon my word, now
I come to think of it, this will be better than dangling
after her. She&rsquo;ll think all the more highly of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us hope so,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;Now, as I think
we understand each other clearly, I&rsquo;ll leave you; I&rsquo;ll come
to you in time for us to catch the train. I must get my
things from the hotel.&rdquo; He moved toward the door, hesitated
a moment, and then came back again. &ldquo;On second
thoughts, I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> leave you. Pack up your things and
come with me now; we can dine together.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, you don&rsquo;t trust me?&rdquo; said Brian with a sneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frankly, I don&rsquo;t; you&rsquo;ve scarcely given me reason to
do so. And the game is too desperate for me to run any
risks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian shrugged his shoulders and began to get his
things together. He stopped once or twice and glanced
rebelliously at his cousin; but Comethup sat on the side
of the bed, with his hands on his hips, looking steadily at
him&mdash;a figure not to be reasoned with, or argued out of
anything he had determined upon.</p>

<p>The dinner at Comethup&rsquo;s hotel passed in silence
until almost the finish; then Brian, warmed by wine,
looked up at the man opposite, and shook his head at him
rallyingly, and spoke in his most charming and playful
manner: &ldquo;My dear old boy, when I&rsquo;m dead you shall
write my biography, the whole amazing business&mdash;&rsquo;pon
my word, you shall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Comethup, shaking his head; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think&mdash;I&rsquo;m quite sure I couldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; replied Comethup gravely, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
done so many things I don&rsquo;t understand; I might&mdash;might
misinterpret them. Employ some one who doesn&rsquo;t know
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They crossed to England together and went on to
London. Comethup left his own luggage at the London
terminus and would have parted there with Brian; but
the latter had a devilish scheme in his head&mdash;a well-contrived
and carefully-thought-out piece of cruelty&mdash;the
only revenge of which he was capable for his defeat.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to leave you here,&rdquo; said Brian; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
got to come on to the house with me, come in with me,
and see your work concluded. By God! I&rsquo;m not going
to have the thing half done; you&rsquo;ve undertaken it, and
you shall see it through to the bitter end. Oh, yes, you
shall see the touching reconciliation between husband
and wife; you shall stand, figuratively, with uplifted
hands to bless them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; said Comethup hastily. &ldquo;Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
not meet her in quite the usual fashion, and&mdash;and make
what excuses you will for your absence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. I&rsquo;m not going to let you off so easily.
I shall say we met in Paris and travelled over together.
I tell you you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you insist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do. You shall find, friend Comethup, that you
don&rsquo;t have things all your own way; we don&rsquo;t part until
you leave me safely in the bosom of my family. You
can&rsquo;t trust me, you know,&rdquo; he added sneeringly.</p>

<p>They drove together to the house. But for that hidden
side of the picture the return of the prodigal would
have been a matter for laughter. Mr. Robert Carlaw was
in the hall, affected almost to tears; he haughtily brushed
aside the servant who would have assisted with the luggage,
and valorously staggered under its weight himself,
murmuring between gasps, &ldquo;My son, my beloved son!&rdquo;
Comethup would have made his escape, but Brian caught
him by the arm and dragged him into the room where
&rsquo;Linda was. She started up and ran to her husband; he
took her with excessive tenderness into his arms, casting
a side glance at his cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my darling,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you hug me as though
you feared you had lost me altogether. Surely you know
my erratic behaviour by this time? I had to rush off to
Paris on business&mdash;business that admitted of no delay.&mdash;Kiss
me again, my love; why, you&rsquo;re almost crying!&mdash;and
in Paris I met Comethup&mdash;dear old moral Comethup
in Paris; think of it! So we travelled home together.
Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be ashamed of your tears or your joy
before Comethup; <i>he</i> doesn&rsquo;t mind&mdash;do you, old chap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With his arm about her he drew her down beside him
on a settee, and looked past her at Comethup with a
smile of triumph in his eyes; held her closer and closer
yet, with little tender caresses for her hands and her hair,
that each might be a stab for the man who stood looking
on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I have some good news for you, my sweetheart.
In Paris I conducted my business so well that I made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
quite a lot of money; we&rsquo;ll be able to live in glorious style.
We&rsquo;ll give up this stuffy house&mdash;what do you think of
that, friend Comethup?&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll have a better one, and
more servants; and, by Heaven! you shall drive a carriage.
We&rsquo;ll give dinners, and go out, and mix with
people; you shall be the best-dressed woman in London.
What do you think of <i>that</i>, old Comethup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I don&rsquo;t want all those things,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Linda
softly, nestling to him. &ldquo;So that I have you it would
not matter, even if we were poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, my darling! there&rsquo;s no talk of poverty; I
tell you we&rsquo;re rich.&rdquo; He burst into a roar of laughter.
&ldquo;By &rsquo;Jove! I&rsquo;d no idea that poetry could ever pay so well.
But there, while we are spooning and thinking about ourselves,
we&rsquo;re forgetting old Comethup. I dare say he&rsquo;ll
want to be going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Comethup slowly, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be going.
Good-night, &rsquo;Linda, good-night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was crossing the little hall when Brian dashed out
of the room after him, closing the door behind him. He
came up to Comethup with his face completely changed,
with the hard look upon it which it had worn during their
interview in the hotel at Paris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, you know,&rdquo; he said quickly, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have
no misunderstanding about this. A bargain&rsquo;s a bargain;
I&rsquo;ve fulfilled my part, now it&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not likely to forget,&rdquo; replied Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we want money at once. I&rsquo;m going to take
you at your word. You want to see this comedy played
out, and, by Heaven! you&rsquo;ll have to pay for staging it.
It&rsquo;s a fair bargain: you have the fun of looking on, and
I&rsquo;ve got to play. Did I play my part well to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup looked at him for a moment and made a
movement as though he would strike him; then let his
hand fall and turned away. &ldquo;Almost too well,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, there I don&rsquo;t agree with you; one can&rsquo;t play a
part too well.&mdash;So I shall expect to hear from you&mdash;say,
to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you shall hear from me to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw was hovering about near the hall
door with a look of expectancy on his face, and a hand
darting out to seize Comethup if possible. But Comethup
was in no mood to be stopped; he thrust him aside
and went out, and walked rapidly down the street.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Linda, &rsquo;Linda, my poor &rsquo;Linda!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;God
grant he plays his part well to the end!&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="subheading">UNCLE ROBERT HAS AN INSPIRATION.</p>


<p>The pretty comedy to which Brian had referred had
been running with something of regularity for over six
months; the staging of it had been a more costly matter
than Comethup had believed possible. His own expenses
were small enough&mdash;indeed, he cut them down to the lowest
figure; but Brian had seen in him an inexhaustible
mine, from which he could demand whatever he wanted
at any moment, light-heartedly enough. To do Brian
justice, he had no knowledge of what the actual sum
was on which his cousin had to depend, nor, indeed, did
he care. He held the younger man strictly to his bargain&mdash;even
threatened desertion, at the slightest remonstrance
on Comethup&rsquo;s part against reckless expenditure.
&rsquo;Linda had no suspicion of the true state of affairs; she
knew that there was always plenty of money, that they
went out a great deal, that many well-known and clever
people came to their house, that their doings when they
went into the country or abroad were chronicled for all
the world to read. Brian, <i>her</i> Brian, of whom she was so
fond and so proud, had produced another book of verses,
and the people she met talked to her about them, even
quoted lines of them; they sometimes coupled her husband&rsquo;s
name with the names of certain wondrous young
poets of bygone days. It was a never-failing source of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
delight that he had, on an impulse, dedicated this last
book &ldquo;To the Woman who stands always most near to
Me.&rdquo; She knew what that meant; she kissed the dear
lines on the printed page again and again because she was
so proud to think that all the world knew what it meant,
and knew to whom the poet referred.</p>

<p>If, sometimes, at her own house or in the houses of
others she met a tall, grave-faced man who said little to
any one and who generally lounged in doorways or in out-of-the-way
corners; if sometimes&mdash;indeed, very often&mdash;she
glanced at him to find his eyes looking wistfully at
her; if, in the dead of night, when she could not sleep
sometimes, she had a sudden remembrance of him and
of his loneliness, and of the old garden far away, where
they had whispered together, it was all so fleeting&mdash;just
a little breath of pain, as it were, across the perfect happiness
of her days&mdash;that she forgot it at once and was
glad to think that he must have left his sorrow behind
him long ago, and have ceased to trouble about what could
never be. In those months she was so supremely happy
and her life was so crowded that she could not bear to
think that any one else was unhappy through any mistake
of hers, and so dismissed the matter at last, feeling
sure that he too had dismissed it long since.</p>

<p>Of late, finding that he had but to ask to receive at
once, Brian had carried the game on even more recklessly
than before. He had long since demanded&mdash;almost
immediately after the return from Paris&mdash;that an account
should be opened in his name at a bank into which
he could pay the sums received from Comethup; he felt,
he said, that it looked so much better to write cheques
for what was wanted. But a thousand pounds per annum
will not stretch sufficiently to cover everything, and the
moment arrived when Comethup was informed that his
own account was considerably overdrawn. And there
were still two months to wait before Miss Charlotte Carlaw
would pay in anything more.</p>

<p>For himself it did not matter, although even he would
be put to it for small personal expenses. But he sat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
trembling fear that Brian might make a demand upon
him any day, a demand which for the first time he would
be unable to meet. While he was puzzling helplessly over
the matter the demand arrived, borne by Mr. Robert Carlaw,
who wore a troubled countenance. He had of late
been the go-between of the cousins; he still lived in his
son&rsquo;s house, and was chiefly useful in entertaining dull
visitors and performing petty offices for which Brian had
no time nor inclination.</p>

<p>His method when seeking Comethup was a simple
one: he did not care to go near the house, but caught the
first small boy on whom he could lay hands and gave him
a few coppers to take a note to the house, addressed to
Comethup. The note was invariably couched in the same
pitiful strain, imploring his dear nephew to grant him an
interview in the street, where he was humbly waiting
with despair tugging heavily at his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, dear boy,&rdquo; he exclaimed fervently on this
occasion, &ldquo;how can I thank you? If, like Brian, I were
a poet I could compare you to the sun at midday, to the
blessed rain from heaven upon a parched earth. Not
being a poet, although I once had some pretensions in
that direction, I am compelled to say &lsquo;Bless you, my dear
boy, bless you!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Comethup, as they paced slowly down a
side street, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, we are on the verge of ruin,&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Robert Carlaw. &ldquo;Why should I disguise the
fact from you? Why should I hide from you, who know
the whole deplorable circumstances, the miserable truth?
This morning a letter has arrived, threatening a distraint
upon our goods unless a large sum of money be paid by
to-morrow. Think of it, a distraint upon our goods!
The horror, the disgrace of it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, smiting his
forehead with one hand and waving the other despairingly.
&ldquo;That is our cursed temperament&mdash;my son&rsquo;s and mine&mdash;that
we can go on through the world like happy children,
laughing in the sunshine, picking the brilliant flowers
of life, heedless of everything; when a storm comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
and the wind howls&mdash;you follow my metaphor?&mdash;we are
lost, absolutely lost. Others were born to face the world
and its trials, to make a stubborn fight of it if necessary;
we are exotics, my son and I, under an open sky, and we
perish miserably. In point of fact, we are on the eve
of perishing miserably at this moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; replied Comethup slowly, &ldquo;but on this
occasion I can&rsquo;t help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw stopped and touched his arm, and
peered anxiously into his face, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help us?&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that I have no money; that it&rsquo;s all gone,
and that I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have any more for perhaps another two
months. I&rsquo;ve already drawn more than was due to me
at the bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear boy,&rdquo; whimpered his uncle, &ldquo;what is
to become of us, what is to become of <i>me</i>? Think of the
position: you have taught me to be dependent upon you,
to look to you for the supply of those little comforts&mdash;not
to say luxuries&mdash;which are necessary to a man of my
position. I have felt so&mdash;so safe! Fortune has not been
good to me; Fortune has stripped me of everything; and
then, at the last moment, melting a little toward me, has
pointed to you and has said in effect: &lsquo;Go to Comethup;
our dear Comethup will assist you.&rsquo; And I have
come to you accordingly. My dear nephew, what is to
become of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup faced about and looked at him contemptuously.
&ldquo;Yes, I know, you&rsquo;ve come to me for everything;
have relied upon me for everything. I&rsquo;ve had a thousand
a year from my aunt, and, as God&rsquo;s my witness, I haven&rsquo;t
spent fifty of it. It&rsquo;s all gone to feed you, and your son,
and&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, and a gentler expression came over his
face&mdash;&ldquo;yes, and &rsquo;Linda. Well, I suppose it&rsquo;s all right;
you&rsquo;d got to be fed and kept going somehow, and it was
easier for me to do it than it would have been for any
one else. But now, here&rsquo;s an end of it. I&rsquo;d help you
if I could&mdash;you know that but I simply can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s impossible
for me to go to my aunt, even if I could bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
myself to do it; she&rsquo;d want to know where the money had
gone, would want to know a thousand things I can&rsquo;t tell
her. I tell you things have come to a deadlock; you&rsquo;ve
drained me&mdash;you and Brian&mdash;and you can drain me no
further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw walked slowly up and down the
street with his head sunk upon his breast in profound
thought; Comethup paced slowly at his side. After a
time the elder man raised his head and thumped his
chest, and spoke in a tone of renewed hopefulness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a crisis of this kind, my dear nephew, despair is
useless; we see before us a certain situation, and that
situation has to be faced. In this world we are beings
of one of two orders&mdash;we are either men or mice. If
we are mice we submit to be crushed&rdquo;&mdash;he stamped his
heel vigorously on the pavement&mdash;&ldquo;while if we are men
we face the situation boldly and rise superior to it. In
this case we are men; we refuse to be crushed. For myself
I would not care; ever the sport of fortune as I
have been, I yet may cut a figure in the world, even
though it be a ragged one; &lsquo;The Vagabond&rsquo; has always
been my favourite song. But my heart is torn at the
thought of others. I dare not return and see them hold
out empty hands to me and cry for bread and tell them
I have but a stone. My dear boy, it is not to be done;
vagabond I may be, but I am still, I trust, a gentleman,
and my heart beats true to those of my own flesh and
blood. Think, my boy, think of Brian and of his young
wife, and then tell me, if you will, that I am to go back
to them and bow my head before them and say, &lsquo;Behold
me; I have failed!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear uncle,&rdquo; exclaimed Comethup in despair,
&ldquo;what am I to do? Show me any way, and I&rsquo;ll
adopt it gladly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear nephew,&rdquo; said Mr. Robert Carlaw, with his
chin resting meditatively in his hand, &ldquo;there <i>is</i> a way,
and an easy one, for a man in your position. Come, let
us face facts: you are your aunt&rsquo;s heir; if she died to-morrow&mdash;may
Heaven spare her for many years!&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
would have every penny she possesses. Such is your good
fortune. Now, my dear nephew, it has been my most
sorry fate to have to deal on occasion with the shady
side of life; I have had, I may say, to get through it as
best I could, and in the easiest possible fashion. Your
path has been different; you have gone along in the sunshine,
with some one else to clear the way for you; hence,
you know nothing of these matters. But let me tell you
this, my dear boy&rdquo;&mdash;he tapped a persuasive forefinger on
Comethup&rsquo;s arm&mdash;&ldquo;that there are men in this city to-day,
personally known to me, who would be willing at a
moment&rsquo;s notice to advance any sum you might name
within reason to a man with your prospects. Don&rsquo;t mistake
me,&rdquo; he added hurriedly. &ldquo;I am not urging that
you should do anything dishonourable. Frankly, the
thing amounts to this: you go to A. upon my introduction;
A. says in effect: &lsquo;What! is this Mr. Willis, the
favourite nephew of Miss Charlotte Carlaw? And he is
in want of money, just to tide him over until such time
as he may, in the indefinite future, come into his fortune?
Nothing easier,&rsquo; says A. &lsquo;How much does Mr. Willis
want?&rsquo; And there, my boy, the thing&rsquo;s done. Do you
follow me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I follow you,&rdquo; said Comethup slowly. &ldquo;And so
you want me to use her name, the name of a woman who&rsquo;s
been the best friend ever a man had; you want me to
look out so eagerly for dead men&rsquo;s shoes&mdash;or a dead
woman&rsquo;s, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which&mdash;that I am to sell them
before she&rsquo;s finished wearing them? No, you&rsquo;ve made a
mistake, Uncle Bob; I don&rsquo;t intend to do it. You and
Brian have been living at my expense at the rate of over
a thousand a year; to put it plainly, you&rsquo;ve had every
penny, or nearly every penny, that I&rsquo;ve ever possessed
since I was a boy. I don&rsquo;t mind that, but the thing has
got to stop. Beyond what I have I won&rsquo;t go; you&rsquo;ve been
welcome to all that, and I don&rsquo;t mind. But I&rsquo;ll go no
further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw sighed and began to ponder the
matter again; he was not quite certain of his cards, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
least of those he could safely play; but he had a vague
feeling that there was one trump card in his possession
which might well be risked. The matter was desperate,
and he resolved to play desperately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know best,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Frankly, I honour
you&mdash;honour you for the noble position you take up at
such a moment. When I consider your simplicity, your
clear and beautiful nature, I feel like a modern Mephistopheles
whispering temptation into your ear. But in
this, as in all other matters, a man must look at a thing
from his own standpoint, or from the standpoint of those
who most nearly concern him. Doubtless you are right;
let us say no more about it. The crash has come, and
we must meet it. I have met worse blows than this, and
Brian, being the son of his most unfortunate father, must
learn to meet them too; doubtless it will be a salutary
lesson to him. Men have strong hands and, I trust, stout
hearts; if it rested with Brian and myself alone I would
not mind; but there is some one else to consider, some
one weak and helpless who knows nothing of any tragedy
which may be impending over her.&rdquo; He sighed again
and shook his head with an air of deep dejection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean &rsquo;Linda?&rdquo; said Comethup, without looking
at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I refer to that sweet girl. I am a man of quick and
strong imagination; a moment ago I seemed to have a
sudden mental picture of that child when she first
learned the position in which we stand, when she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she mustn&rsquo;t learn it,&rdquo; cried Comethup hurriedly.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw shook his head again. &ldquo;My
dear young friend, a wife&rsquo;s place is by her husband; when
the crash falls she will unhesitatingly&mdash;oh, I know the
nobility of her character&mdash;she will, I say, unhesitatingly
place her hand in that of her husband and will say, &lsquo;Together
we have been prosperous, together we will bow our
heads before the storm.&rsquo; Poor child, poor child, that it
should come to this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I had lost sight of her,&rdquo; said Comethup.
&ldquo;Of course she doesn&rsquo;t understand, doesn&rsquo;t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
any of the circumstances; I&rsquo;d forgotten that. She&rsquo;s gone
on, day by day, believing that all this money came from
him; proud of him; glad that the world, as she thought,
should shower its gold upon her clever husband, upon the
man she loves. Yes, I&rsquo;d forgotten all that.&rdquo; He spoke
as if to himself, without noticing his companion. He saw
in a moment that this thing he had built up for her sake
was in danger of being swept away; that she might be
left stripped and trembling in a desert, with all that
had made her life perfect torn away from her. He
thought of her proud and happy face when he had seen
her but a little time since with her husband; saw again,
far away from the street in which he walked, a little
lonely child in a garden; heard himself, as a boy, tell the
old captain that he meant to look after her. Comethup
Willis was of the stuff of which the fabled knights might
have been made&mdash;one who simply and earnestly and splendidly
set before him a task to be done and did it without
wavering or turning aside. His own pain, his own longing
counted for nothing; the child of the old days seemed
to be stretching out her hands to him and crying to
him, as she had done years before when they had first met;
the cry was not to be resisted.</p>

<p>He looked up with a start and found the eyes of Mr.
Robert Carlaw fixed upon him. &ldquo;You say that it is possible&mdash;honourably&mdash;to
get an advance from some one?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The easiest thing in the world. Of course, there
will be interest to be paid, and&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve no doubt that
the interest will be somewhat high; but that is a mere
matter for arrangement. As I have said, the fact of
your aunt&rsquo;s wealth is well known; the further fact that
she has refused to have anything to do with any of her
relatives but your fortunate self is equally well known.
My dear nephew, in this world of ours if a man has anything
substantial behind him it is the easiest thing in
the world for him to get what he wants. I can take you
to a man this very hour, if necessary, who will conduct
the business for you. And, let me tell you another thing:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
for the future it is my fixed intention to insist upon it
that there shall be no further extravagance. We must
not run the risk of another crisis of this character. In
a little time we shall be able to pull ourselves straight,
to repay this money, and so&mdash;if I may suggest so much&mdash;put
your conscience at rest. Whatever money is advanced
can be paid back, and my good sister will know
nothing of the transaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure there is no other way?&rdquo; asked Comethup.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw spread out his hands with an air
of charming frankness. &ldquo;Suggest one, my dear nephew,
and I will instantly give you my opinion concerning it.
Candidly, I can see no way so simple or so easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Comethup in a low voice. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
go at once and get it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They drove to an office in a quiet court in the city,
and there Comethup was left in an outer room, where a
solitary clerk was busily writing, while Mr. Robert Carlaw
had a private interview with the accommodating gentleman
who was so willing to lift other people&rsquo;s troubles
away from them. &ldquo;It will be best for me just to&mdash;to
pave the way, as it were,&rdquo; he had said when they reached
the place.</p>

<p>That necessary formality over, Comethup was shown
in, and found a bland and smiling gentleman, of a somewhat
pronounced type of features, anxious to shake him
at once with much fervour by the hand. His uncle had,
it appeared, with that consideration which characterized
him, put the whole matter so fairly and clearly before this
gentleman that the money was at Comethup&rsquo;s instant disposal;
indeed, it seemed such an ordinary and simple piece
of business that Comethup&rsquo;s mind was considerably
lightened. There were papers to be signed, and it appeared
that Mr. Robert Carlaw had suggested, in order
to avoid troubling his dear nephew again, that the loan
should be for a thousand pounds. The rate of interest,
as he had said, was extremely high, but then the circumstances
were peculiar; and in order that there might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
no misunderstanding the interest for one year was deducted
from the amount of the cheque, so that the cheque
itself was very, very far short of the sum which had been
named.</p>

<p>However, the thing was rapidly concluded, and uncle
and nephew were ushered out of the office. When once
the money had been placed in Mr. Robert Carlaw&rsquo;s
hands Comethup laid a detaining hand on his shoulder.
&ldquo;Look here, you know,&rdquo; he said, with some sternness,
&ldquo;let us have no nonsense about this matter. I am sorry
to refer to it, but on a former occasion&mdash;in Rome, you
remember&mdash;when I put money into your hands it never
reached its destination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Carlaw, bridling, &ldquo;do you
imagine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I imagine nothing,&rdquo; replied Comethup quietly; &ldquo;I
am merely speaking of what occurred. This is a different
matter, and I think&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;m quite sure&mdash;that I&rsquo;d better
go home with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw shrugged his shoulders, but submitted
to being thrust into a hansom with Comethup
close at his elbow. At the corner of the street in which
Brian lived the cab was dismissed, and they walked down
the street together. Some fifty yards from the house
Comethup stopped and nodded to his uncle to go on
alone. That gentleman shook hands with him effusively,
and went on and ran up the steps leading to the door,
with a brisk air; waved a hand to his nephew, and disappeared.
Comethup waited about for some time and
finally went home.</p>

<p>Now, the mind of Mr. Robert Carlaw was divided between
two sets of emotions during the next day or so.
In the first place, he was honestly glad to have got so
neatly out of an impending trouble; while, on the other
hand, he fretted and chafed when he thought of the hand
which had lifted the trouble from him. He had never
ceased to think bitterly of the boy who had, as he considered,
stepped into his son&rsquo;s place; had never ceased to
occupy his mind with schemes, however wild and futile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
which might turn the tables. And thus it happened that
an idea came to him, so wild and daring that at first he
rejected it; but it grew and grew, and shaped itself, until
at last it seemed in all points and from every aspect so
extremely beautiful that he wondered, almost in an awed
fashion, what special providence could have guided him
to it.</p>

<p>The theatrical nature of the man, glorying in big
effects and surprises and flourishes, compelled him to
carry out the business secretly; and then, when he had
brought it to a successful issue, to declare the fact triumphantly.
Accordingly he said nothing to Brian about
the matter, but went out early and returned home late
in the pursuit of his object. And that object was to
gain a private interview with his sister, Miss Charlotte
Carlaw.</p>

<p>The opportunity came at last. He had watched the
house for some days in the hope of seeing Comethup
leave it; had haunted corners and doorways, waiting for
his chance. At last, one evening he saw the young man
come out in evening dress and enter the waiting carriage
and drive away alone. Mr. Carlaw readily conjectured
that he was going to a dinner party, and after
waiting for a few minutes longer he walked up to the
house and rang the bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you inform Miss Carlaw,&rdquo; he said in his sweetest
manner to the servant, &ldquo;that a gentleman wishes to
see her on urgent private business? I will not give my
name; Miss Carlaw knows me quite well. Oh, and say
that I regret to trouble her at such an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man carried the message and presently returned
to say that Miss Carlaw would see him. He was ushered
into a room where she sat in solitary state at dinner.
She turned her head inquiringly toward the door as he
softly entered. There was no need for him to speak, for
she knew him instantly. The frown on her face was not
encouraging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, brother Bob, what do <i>you</i> want?&rdquo; she asked
sharply. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s the mystery, that you can&rsquo;t send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
up your name like an honest creature? Afraid I shouldn&rsquo;t
see you, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Charlotte,&rdquo; replied Mr. Carlaw, &ldquo;you always
appear to do me an injustice in your thoughts. It
is, perhaps, late in the day now to attempt to change
your opinion of me; yet I venture to suggest that you
will be surprised to learn that my errand to-night is undertaken&mdash;may
I say it?&mdash;in pure unselfishness, and with
the desire to do a fellow-creature a service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should certainly be very much surprised to
hear <i>that</i>, Bob,&rdquo; replied his sister with a shrewd smile.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not generally taken in that way; but it&rsquo;s never
too late to mend, you know. You can sit down. I&rsquo;m all
alone, as you see; my boy has gone out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw sighed heavily and seated himself.
&ldquo;I am very glad,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;to find you alone; what I
have to say is of a private and confidential character, and&mdash;forgive
me, I beg&mdash;somewhat painful. In fact, it would
have been impossible for me to speak before my nephew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; replied the old woman.
She was frowning again, but seemed to be listening very
intently. &ldquo;I have no secrets from my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my poor sister; the gods have not been good to
you. Blinded by nature, you have, I fear, also been
blinded by something stronger than nature&mdash;love. You
say you have no secrets from the boy; that does not
necessarily imply that he has none from you. Do you
follow me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;ve anything to say about Comethup,
why, in the devil&rsquo;s name, can&rsquo;t you say it before
his face? You never did do things in a straightforward,
honest fashion; there was always something crooked
about you. If you&rsquo;ve heard anything about my boy, or
against him, I&rsquo;ll tell you to begin with that it&rsquo;s a pack
of lies, and whatever it is I won&rsquo;t hear it! I&rsquo;m keen
enough and I know enough of the world to know what the
boy&rsquo;s worth; he&rsquo;s not of your stamp, and never will be,
please God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, you observe,&rdquo; said Mr. Carlaw, addressing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
furniture, &ldquo;the absolute accuracy and beauty of my reasoning.
I told you that you were blinded by love. What
I have heard comes from no third party; I love and
esteem my nephew so well that had any one dared to
breathe a word against him, that person would have felt
the weight of my displeasure. I am, I trust, my dear
sister, still a gentleman, whatever my worldly position
may be, and I do not carry idle tales. I came to you to-night
because it is my earnest wish, as I just now hinted,
to help that young man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt he&rsquo;d be immensely obliged to you
if he heard you say so,&rdquo; broke in Miss Carlaw, &ldquo;but I
think he can do without your help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; replied her brother sadly. &ldquo;I risk
your displeasure&mdash;your anger&mdash;I know, in saying what I
am about to say, but my duty is clear, and I <i>must</i> speak.
Will you pardon me for saying that into whatever pitfalls
our dear nephew has plunged the fault is not, perhaps,
entirely his own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Carlaw got up from her chair and came
round the table with the aid of her stick and stopped exactly
opposite her brother. &ldquo;Pitfalls? What are you talking
about? You&rsquo;ve come here to say something; why the
devil can&rsquo;t you say it? I suppose I&rsquo;m bound to listen to
you; a fellow of your sort must tell his lies in some ear
or other if he can&rsquo;t gain the attention of the one he first
seeks. Now&rdquo;&mdash;she rapped her stick furiously on the
floor&mdash;&ldquo;out with it! What have you to say about my
boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Charlotte, you are, I observe, as impatient
as ever. My sole desire was to break the matter gently to
you, in order, if possible, to save you any unnecessary
pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pain? What should pain me?&rdquo; Yet her voice and
her face were a little troubled as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Charlotte, I know your generous nature,
and I know&mdash;or I can guess&mdash;how lavishly you have dealt
with this boy. It has been my good fortune to meet him
once or twice, or perhaps I should say to see him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
the distance; for we move, as you are aware, in different
spheres. I have seen the richness of his dress; I
have observed that he never appears to be in want of
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do things by halves,&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw with
a little touch of pride. &ldquo;I said I would look after the
boy, and I&rsquo;ve done it. But what has all this to do with
you&mdash;or with what you have to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything, my dear sister, everything. I suppose&mdash;forgive
the question, but it is necessary&mdash;I imagine he
has a large personal income?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has,&rdquo; replied the old woman shortly. &ldquo;A thousand
a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw lifted his hands in amazement.
&ldquo;A thousand a year! Incredible! And even that does
not satisfy him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not satisfy him! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To put the matter plainly, my dear Charlotte, circumstances
which I need not detail took me recently into
a certain quarter of the city. I may state&mdash;not without
a blush, for I&rsquo;m still a gentleman&mdash;that my condition of
life is such that I am compelled sometimes to resort to
various shifts by which to raise money. You have not
had to do that; fortune has been kinder to you than to
others. In this case I had gone to visit a money-lender.
Do I pain you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw quietly. She had backed
away from him a little and was standing beside the fireplace,
with one hand reaching up and resting on the high
mantelshelf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imagine my surprise, my distress, when I met in
such a place your nephew, Comethup Willis!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comethup at a money-lender&rsquo;s! Either you&rsquo;re mad
or you think I am, brother Bob. Or have you suddenly
gone blind, like your sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! my dear Charlotte, I was never more wide-awake
in my life, and never did I speak in more sober earnestness.
I said nothing to the young man at the time,
but the money-lender being a friend, I carefully and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
cautiously questioned him. And then I discovered the
whole disgraceful business.&rdquo; Mr. Robert Carlaw rose to
his feet and began to pace excitedly about the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep still, man, keep still!&rdquo; cried Miss Carlaw furiously,
&ldquo;and get on with your story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man, who, like the rest of his kind, makes the
most of his opportunities, informed me that he had advanced
a large sum of money to young Mr. Willis. On
my inquiring, naturally enough, what security he had
asked, he told me that Mr. Willis had informed him that
he was heir to the whole of Miss Charlotte Carlaw&rsquo;s large
fortune, and that he supposed that fact was security
enough. The man evidently thought so, for he had advanced
your misguided nephew the sum of a thousand
pounds at a ruinous rate of interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Carlaw stood perfectly still for a long time; all
expression seemed to have died out of her face. When at
last she spoke her voice appeared to have changed, to have
aged in some strange fashion. &ldquo;Brother Bob,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;we are of the same blood, you and I, and whatever our
later quarrels may have been we&rsquo;ve played together as
boy and girl. I pray you, Bob, in mercy to me, tell me
that this is some hideous jest. I&rsquo;ll forgive you; I swear
I&rsquo;ll even laugh at you, if only you&rsquo;ll tell me that you&rsquo;ve
come here, knowing my love for this boy, to play a cruel
joke on me, and then to go away and laugh at it.
Brother Bob, tell me you&rsquo;re making fun of me.&rdquo; The appeal
was piteous enough to have melted any heart, but
brother Bob merely shook his head and sighed again more
heavily than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! my dear Charlotte, it is no jest. To say that
I was thunderstruck would be to put the matter mildly;
and I can well imagine what your feelings must be.
What he does with this money is more than I can say; I
can give a shrewd guess, but I may be doing him an
injustice, so I won&rsquo;t say what that guess is. But it is
certainly true that he has raised this money in the
fashion I have explained to you. If you still believe that
I am guilty of such atrocious bad feeling as to jest with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
you on a subject of such a nature, I beg that you will
yourself ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall certainly ask him,&rdquo; replied Miss
Carlaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is wise, that is just,&rdquo; replied her brother. &ldquo;Perhaps
I might suggest that it would be better not to mention
my name in the matter. After all, I am not concerned
in it in any way, and being a man of peace I do
not desire to have this young man&rsquo;s enmity. He will
probably believe that you have heard it through some
business channel of which he knows nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t fear that I shall mention your name.
If he admits it, the fact that I know it is sufficient. Have
you anything more to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, beyond the hope that you will not deal
hardly with him. He is young, thoughtless, headstrong;
he has been brought up extravagantly, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With plenty to be extravagant upon,&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw,
with something of a return of her old manner.
&ldquo;Well, brother Bob, I suppose you&rsquo;ll go home to-night in
triumph; you&rsquo;ll go home and laugh because an old fool
has been blind in a double sense; because she&rsquo;s been fooled
as thousands of women have been fooled before, eh? Oh,
you need have no mercy; go and tell all your friends,
every one who knows you, tell all the world that I have
warmed something in my bosom until at last it has stung
me. Tell &rsquo;em all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, my dear sister,&rdquo; said Mr. Carlaw, &ldquo;you do
me a grave injustice. You spoke just now, not without
emotion, of our childish years; my heart goes out to you
to-night more than it has ever done. I may say that,
having seen much of men and women in this queer world
of ours, I feared something of this from the beginning;
I felt that the boy had not that strength of character, if
I may so term it, necessary to take his place with any
dignity in an exalted sphere. Humbly he might have
done well; the best of us are likely to have our heads
turned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, that will do; I&rsquo;m quite capable of abusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
him myself, if necessary, without your help. I suppose I
ought to thank you for what you&rsquo;ve told me to-night,
but I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t quite do that. I wish, in my heart
of hearts, I might have died five minutes before you came
in, for then his kiss was warm upon my old cheek, and I&mdash;God
help me!&mdash;I believed in him. There, don&rsquo;t speak
to me. Go away, please; I want to be alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw quietly took his way out of the
room and out of the house. As he walked home he
looked up at the night sky and smiled softly to himself,
and felt that the world was good and that Providence
had been specially kind to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women are strange creatures,&rdquo; he muttered to himself,
&ldquo;and when they&rsquo;ve been upset or have had something
rudely torn away from them they do remarkable
things. Years ago, my dear Charlotte, you rejected
my offspring and put Master Comethup Willis in his
place. I may be wrong, but I think now, with the swing
of the pendulum, it is ten thousand chances to one that
you will restore Brian to your favour; and then our begging
days are over, and all our fortunes will be made.
And I shall have made them.&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="subheading">THE FALL OF PRINCE CHARMING.</p>


<p>Miss Carlaw stood for a long time in the same attitude
after her brother had left her; the whole hideous
thing had come upon her so unexpectedly and with such
force that she was like one stunned. She began presently
to pace about the room, moaning once or twice to herself
as she walked, and then again stopping suddenly with a
new light on her face and a smile about her lips. But
those latter moments were rare and fleeting; they came
to her only when she felt for an instant that the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
she had heard was a hideous invention, and that her faith
in Comethup might still remain unshaken.</p>

<p>After a long, long time her heart leaped suddenly at
the sound of wheels and the opening of a door; then died
down again at the thought of the interview before her.
She heard his footstep in the hall, and then knew by the
opening of the room door that he was coming to her as
he always did. She stood stiff and rigid to receive him.</p>

<p>The sound of the voice she loved so well almost shook
her resolution to be stern with him, almost broke her into
an appeal. She knew that in another moment his arm
would be about her shoulders in the old boyish fashion,
and she cried out in an agony, &ldquo;Stop! Stay where you
are. Don&rsquo;t come near me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped dead; so suddenly quiet was he that she
almost fancied he had stopped breathing. Then the tension
was over; he gave a quick little gasp and said hurriedly,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Years ago, Comethup, when I first saw you in the
house wherein your father lay dead, I drove a bargain
with you&mdash;a bargain which, child though you were, you
were fully capable of understanding. Do you remember
it now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo; His heart was beating thickly,
and he had a dim and miserable feeling that he knew
what was coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear you may have forgotten it. I asked for your
love and your confidence; swore that I would be your
friend if you dealt with me openly and squarely through
all things and at all times. Have I kept my word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows you have!&rdquo; he replied in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you kept yours?&mdash;Ah! you are silent on that
point. I ask you to-night if you have anything to tell
me&mdash;anything to say to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised his head and looked at her; even made a
step toward her with his arms stretched out. Then the
arms fell to his sides again and he simply answered,
&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Carlaw&rsquo;s face hardened suddenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then the talking must be done by me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
reminded you just now of our compact when you were a
child; perhaps it will be well to remind you of the penalty
for breaking that compact. I swore to you then,
and I meant it, that if you ever deceived me, ever proved
yourself to be anything but the boy I believed you to be,
I&rsquo;d cast you out and you might starve. I meant it then,
and, by the Lord, I&rsquo;ll keep my word! It has come to my
knowledge to-night that you have done what, in my eyes,
is a shameful and disgraceful thing; that, trading on the
fact that you believed yourself to be my heir, you have
borrowed a large sum of money; have used the bounty
and generosity of a foolish old woman who believed in
you, and so have actually drawn money which you can
not possess until after my death. Will you deny that?
Is it true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Comethup.</p>

<p>She gave a long sigh, turned away from him, leaned
her arm against the side of the fireplace, and laid her
old face against the arm and began to cry helplessly.
It was the most pitiful sight imaginable, and yet he could
do nothing to comfort her, dared not even go near her.
In a dim, forlorn fashion he seemed to see passing before
him all that had happened in that very room&mdash;the riotous
feasts, when he had been a child&mdash;the sound of merry
laughter; he even seemed to see himself as he had once
stood on the table, singing a foolish song, with the captain
watching him silently; he could hear his own childish
treble, could feel again the old woman&rsquo;s hand
grasping his ankle. And now the room was empty and
the generous-hearted old creature, the giver of the
feast, who had craved only for his love in return for
all her bounty, was crying hopelessly over her shattered
idol.</p>

<p>Presently she ceased her weeping and turned upon
him with a certain sad fierceness of manner. &ldquo;Have I
ever denied you anything, boy? Was I so much in your
way or had you given me so little of your love that you
must long for the time when you could step into possession?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
O God! for the dream I have lost! Why, you&rsquo;re
worse than any murderer&mdash;for the things you have killed
in me to-night! I honestly believe that that is the unpardonable
sin&mdash;to kill some trusting fellow-creature&rsquo;s
belief in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll break my heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what of mine; did you think nothing of that?
I swear to you that if you had come to me and had told
me that you were in want or in difficulties I&rsquo;d have helped
you if I&rsquo;d had to mortgage everything I possessed. Your
income has been a large one; it passes my comprehension
to know what you&rsquo;ve done with the money; I&rsquo;m quite
afraid to think. However, that&rsquo;s all done with; I&rsquo;ll never
believe in any human creature again. I believed in you
with all my heart and soul; I saw in you, or thought I did,
something better and truer than in any one else. Now I
find my mistake. Thinking over it now, I see what a fool
I&rsquo;ve been. I remember those days on the Continent when
we were travelling about, and when your money went
more rapidly than I could put it in your hands. I didn&rsquo;t
mind then; I thought you didn&rsquo;t know the value of it,
but would learn in time. Now your chance to learn is
gone. You and I part to-night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood there dumb, knowing that he could say nothing
to her, knowing that he dare not plead for himself.
Indeed, he did not think of himself at that time; he found
himself dimly wondering what was to become of &rsquo;Linda
when this last sum of money was exhausted. He had
never foreseen such a crisis as this. The fashion in
which he had supplied Brian and his father with funds,
beginning as it had done in his boyhood, had grown to
be such a natural thing that he had ceased to be surprised
at it, or, indeed, to think about it very much at all. He
put himself clearly and quietly outside the question; his
heart only ached desperately for this old woman who
was destined to be left alone again after all these years,
despite all her goodness to him. He stood still for a few
moments watching her, and then turned quietly and went
toward the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>She called after him: &ldquo;Have you nothing to say to
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came back slowly. &ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; he said in a
broken voice, &ldquo;what shall I say to you? To thank you
for all that you&rsquo;ve done, all that I seem so shamefully to
have misused, would sound like a mockery. After all, all
that you say is good and fair and just; I have lied to you
and deceived you and broken my bargain; I can&rsquo;t say
anything more than that. Deep as my gratitude is, I
wish&mdash;O God, how much I wish!&mdash;that you had left me
as you found me when I was a little child. I suppose I
wasn&rsquo;t fit or strong enough to take the position you meant
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not. And you won&rsquo;t tell me what you&rsquo;ve
done with all this money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t tell you that,&rdquo; he replied. Before him
again he seemed to see the face of &rsquo;Linda&mdash;&rsquo;Linda, whose
fool&rsquo;s paradise he had created, and who lived in it contentedly,
knowing nothing of what it was founded upon.
In his own steadfast, single-hearted way he knew that that
secret must be kept, and kept to the end for her sake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you won&rsquo;t, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the old woman,
with a sudden return of her hardness of manner. &ldquo;I
suppose it doesn&rsquo;t matter now. But, since you refuse all
explanations, so I refuse to have anything to do with
you further, or with any trouble you have created. You
have borrowed this money under the belief that you were
my heir, but you&rsquo;ve reckoned without me. Here, to-night,
under the very roof where I first gave you all your
honours, I strip them from you. Those who lent you the
money may get it back as they can; I&rsquo;ll encourage no such
business as that. I&rsquo;ll warrant they&rsquo;ll pull long faces when
they find they&rsquo;ve been misled. Yes, I strip everything
from you. The boy I loved, the Prince Charming I worshipped,
is dead&mdash;never has been at all. Another&mdash;a creature
I don&rsquo;t know and don&rsquo;t understand, a stranger to
me&mdash;has taken his place. Prince Charming has gone&mdash;God
help me!&mdash;forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned then and went quietly out of the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
When at the door he looked back for a moment she was
seated in her chair with her hands resting on the top of
her stick, and her face bowed on the hands; she was rocking
herself to and fro in the fashion he remembered so
well.</p>

<p>He stole up to his room, struck a light, and looked
round that happy place of his boyhood for a long time;
then presently closed the door, went down the stairs,
put on his hat, and left the house, taking nothing with
him, but going out as quietly and as steadfastly to begin
the world again as though he had been merely starting
for a quiet half-hour&rsquo;s walk. He had not the faintest
idea of what to do or where to go; there was no one to
whom he could turn, for even the captain would not understand,
and must never be told. Prince Charming, as
the old woman had said, was dead; it would surely be
wiser that he should be forgotten also.</p>

<p class="subheading">BRIAN PAYS HIS DEBTS.</p>


<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw, having once started that beautiful
and simple scheme which he had devised, felt that
something more was necessary for its completion; the
first bold stroke had been given, but other bold strokes
would be needed. Accordingly, he set about the matter
delicately; sent copies of Brian&rsquo;s books of verse to the old
woman, in order, as it were, to prepare the way for the
entry of the poet himself into the position which had
been so long usurped by another. He had decided not to
tell his son anything about the matter until the business
had been successfully concluded and Miss Charlotte Carlaw
was ready to open her arms to her new heir.</p>

<p>But when day after day went by and then week after
week, and there came no response from his sister, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
began to be possessed with doubts and fears; wondered
if, after all, he had snatched away the one means of living
left open to them all, and had failed to discover another.
He told himself, however, with a knowing shake of the
head, that he knew women better than that; he counted
on the fact of Miss Carlaw&rsquo;s desperate loneliness should
she have discarded Comethup. Perplexed and troubled
and trembling, Mr. Carlaw at last made up his mind to
seek his sister and endeavour to learn the true position
of affairs.</p>

<p>He was admitted without delay to her presence, and
found her standing in the same room and in the same
attitude as when he had last seen her, almost as though
she had not moved since. But her face was worn, and lines
appeared upon it which he did not remember to have seen
before; for the rest she was as upright and dignified as
ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, brother Bob,&rdquo; she said, with some bitterness,
&ldquo;have you brought me any other fine news? Do you
come again, in pure unselfishness, with the desire solely
to help a fellow-creature? Come, let&rsquo;s know what you
want. Out with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sister,&rdquo; began Mr. Carlaw, &ldquo;when last I
saw you, on a memorable and a painful occasion, I went
away with the horrible fear tugging at my heart that it
would have been wiser had I said nothing; that the probability
was that you would behave&mdash;quite naturally, I admit&mdash;somewhat
harshly to a foolish and headstrong
youth. That fear has haunted me ever since, and haunts
me still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid it will have to continue haunting
you, brother Bob,&rdquo; replied Miss Carlaw dryly. &ldquo;If you
want to know full particulars of the matter I can tell
you in a dozen words. I asked my nephew whether the
statement was true or false; he admitted that it was true.
He left my house that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw, remembering his sister&rsquo;s affliction,
felt it safe to indulge in a smile of satisfaction; but his
tones when he spoke were tinged with sadness. &ldquo;My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
dear Charlotte,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is quite what I feared.
Will you not permit me to plead for the boy, to suggest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; broke in Miss Carlaw fiercely. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know why you come here, unless you want to triumph
over a lonely old woman; but I want to hear nothing
more about the matter. The boy is done with, and
I won&rsquo;t listen to the pleading of an archangel about him.
Have you anything more to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Carlaw hesitated for a few moments and then
began his petition lamely. &ldquo;My dear sister, I will not,
of course, say anything further about the unhappy matter
if you do not desire to have it spoken about. Perhaps
I may say that, more than anything else, my heart has
been touched for you; my sympathy has gone out to you
in this hour of your loneliness more than you would think
possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was lonely for a good many years, brother Bob, and
it didn&rsquo;t seem to affect you much. Come, deal squarely
with me; what is it you want to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Charlotte, you are ever impatient; but that
is characteristic of you, and I think I love you for it&mdash;I&rsquo;m
quite sure I do. I was going to suggest, if I might
be permitted to do so, that having been used for so long
to young society you will naturally feel the desire for that
sort of society very strongly. In a word, my dear sister,
you want to be taken out of yourself, as it were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go on,&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw, who was listening intently.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, her brother proceeded more glibly:
&ldquo;Now, it has seemed to me that if you could receive
visits from&mdash;may I say it?&mdash;from those who are interested
in you, those whose society is cheerful, whose lives
are fresh and sweet and unspotted from the world, it
would have a beneficial effect upon you. Now, for example,
my son Brian&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She burst suddenly into a peal of bitter, scornful
laughter; the man stopped and looked at her angrily.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bad pleader, brother Bob,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t do the thing well at all. So this is your idea, is it?
You think that as I have got rid of one who seemed all
the world to me, and who seemed to take the first place
in my heart&mdash;you think, because of that, you&rsquo;ll suggest a
substitute.&rdquo; She stamped her foot and rapped her stick
upon the ground. &ldquo;No, a thousand times no! I tried
with one; thought him the best there was on earth; I&rsquo;ll
try no more. Still less should I be disposed to put in his
place one who comes of such a stock as you. It&rsquo;s a pretty
idea, brother Bob; &rsquo;pon my word, it&rsquo;s a fine idea! But it
won&rsquo;t do; from this moment forward I&rsquo;ve done with everything
and every one. I thought I could find love and
truth in the world; I&rsquo;ve failed to find them, although
God knows I&rsquo;ve tried hard enough. Therefore I have the
right to say that I don&rsquo;t believe they exist; and I <i>shall</i>
say it, and take my way through life accordingly. Now,
I ask only one thing and I intend to have it; and that one
thing is&mdash;to be left alone, to be troubled no more with
any of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear sister, be reasonable; think for a moment
of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think!&rdquo; she echoed bitterly. &ldquo;Do you imagine
that I haven&rsquo;t thought and thought and thought until
my brain reels; until all my past days, good and bad, file
before my darkened eyes like a long-drawn-out procession
that never ends? Is it possible for you, I wonder,
to understand all that this thing means to me? Is it possible
for you to know how I wander through the empty
rooms of this place and hear his voice again as I heard
it when he was a child? Heavens, man! do you know
what it is to have set up something to worship, to have
had nothing else in all your life that was quite so fine
and splendid, and then to be told quite suddenly that
you&rsquo;ve been dreaming; that it never existed, that you&rsquo;ve
been cheating yourself all the time and have got to unlearn
all the pretty fable you&rsquo;ve taught yourself? And
then you think I could fill his place; you imagine I
could start all over again with the chance of being
cheated afresh? I know now what was meant when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
was written that a rich man couldn&rsquo;t enter into heaven;
I suppose it applies equally well to a rich woman. This
was my heaven, more than a paradise; and my accursed
wealth has driven me out of it and closed it to me forever!
If I had been poor, he might have clung to me
and cared for nothing else, but the money stood in the
way. Well, I ought to have known; I&rsquo;m old enough to
have learned my lesson before this. Now, brother Bob,
let&rsquo;s put an end to this; go your way and I&rsquo;ll go mine.
That&rsquo;s my final word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He knew that she meant it; saw in one horrible moment
that he had lost, and that to plead with her would
be of no more use than to fling himself against a rock.
Coming out into the streets he walked along with his hat
tilted on the back of his head, staring before him in a
dazed fashion as he went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Bob Carlaw,&rdquo; he muttered to himself,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve most decidedly made a horrible mess of things.
You&rsquo;ve killed the goose that laid the golden eggs, with a
vengeance. I thought this was going to be the smartest
thing I&rsquo;d ever done. Worst of all, there&rsquo;s Brian to be
faced, and Brian&rsquo;s temper is positively devilish. This
comes of trying to help others; if I&rsquo;d fought for my own
hand through life I believe I should really have cut a
figure in the world, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kept his miserable secret for some weeks, hoping
that an event would occur which would render it unnecessary
for the matter to be disclosed at all, trusting in that
Providence which in a vague fashion he had alternately
blessed and cursed all his days. There was a forced
gaiety about him at this time; he burst into unnatural
snatches of song at the most inopportune and unexpected
moments, as though to keep his spirits up and to assure
his doubting mind that all was well. But the crash came
when Brian, finding that funds were running low, airily
suggested to his father that the usual appeal should be
made to Comethup Willis.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw, in coward fashion, put off the matter
for a day or two; and then, when concealment was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
longer possible, blurted out the truth, not without tears.
He implored his son, his dear son, to remember that he
had at all times been a fond and indulgent parent, and
that he had in this as in all other things acted for the
best. He urged, moreover, that they should not yet despair;
his eccentric sister might restore Comethup to her
favour, or might, best of all, look with kindly eyes upon
Brian and his young wife. Their credit was good, owing
to the costly manner in which they had lived. There was
still time, the trembling man argued, in which to look
about them and make up their minds what to do.</p>

<p>To say that Brian was stunned by the intelligence
would be to put the matter mildly. In characteristic
fashion he had gone on from day to day, complacently
confident that the next would bring all that he needed to
make life pleasant; and here in a moment he saw the
whole thing stripped away from him&mdash;saw in imagination
the pleasant prospect upon which he had so long gazed
closed in by the hard, dull wall of privation, against
which he might beat his hands in vain. He had lived in
luxury like a spoiled child, ministering to his every whim
and caprice, happy and flattered and careless of everything
and every one about him. When at last he fully
grasped what had happened, his fury and violence were
greater even than his father could have imagined; he
cursed that long-suffering man roundly, cursed every circumstance
of what he termed his poverty-stricken existence,
and ended his outburst by whimpering feebly, like a
child thrust out suddenly in the cold and the darkness.</p>

<p>Left alone, the natural cowardice of the man took a
new form. It had never been his habit to bear the burdens
of life&mdash;that was a matter which might more easily
be left to others; he determined he would not bear this
one. To justify his conduct had never been necessary;
he had been fortunate in seeing always the easiest path to
travel, and had immediately taken it, even though such
an action involved the stepping over some one else to
reach it. Consequently there was no thought in his mind
now of the sufferings or troubles which might be incurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
by any one near to him. Brian Carlaw was the one person
to be considered, and Brian Carlaw must not starve.
If any justification were necessary, he told himself with
something of pride that he had a work to perform&mdash;a
work for which the world asked and waited; he owed a
duty to the world and must perform it at whatever cost.
This being the case, when his first anger was gone he
looked about for a means of escape. Difficulties were
closing in about him, and he must get away from the
net while yet there was time.</p>

<p>So it happened that, not for the first time in the history
of this amazing pair, Mr. Robert Carlaw found himself
one day again deserted. Brian had gone, leaving
behind him a letter to his father written in quite his best
and airiest fashion, and urging that gentleman to break
the news to the deserted wife.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw was, not unnaturally, annoyed; he
felt that his son&rsquo;s action savoured of base ingratitude
when it was remembered that the father had tried to do
so much. &ldquo;And the worst of it is,&rdquo; he muttered to himself
as he read the letter, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;s left the woman on my
hands. That&rsquo;s the coolest part of the business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;Linda, all unsuspecting, greeted him with a smile as
he entered the room; for he went to her at once, ready to
blurt out the matter without preface or disguise of any
kind. He felt that he was the deeply injured party, and
it was convenient that she should be there that he might
pour out his wrongs to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look troubled,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;Is anything
the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter! The most infernal, disgraceful, and degrading
business that has ever come to my knowledge.
&lsquo;How sharper than a serpent&rsquo;s tooth!&rsquo;&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ve found
out what <i>that</i> means. Here am I, who have sacrificed
myself, sacrificed everything on earth, for the sake of an
ungrateful rascal who deserts me at a moment&rsquo;s notice.
And then you ask me if anything is the matter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had risen from her chair and was looking at him
with a troubled expression, with the fingers of one hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
trembling nervously at her throat. In the storm of words
she had caught only one or two; one of them she had
caught particularly. &ldquo;Deserted!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s not much mystery about it, I should
think,&rdquo; he cried brutally. &ldquo;Brian has gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him in silence for a moment with a sudden
fear whitening her face; then a little laugh crept to
her lips and trembled there, as though she would cheat
herself with the thought that the man was jesting. &ldquo;But
where has he gone?&rdquo; she asked lightly. &ldquo;Have you been
quarrelling with him again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quarrel? There has been no question of quarrelling.
The fellow has simply sneaked away and left me&mdash;I mean
us&mdash;in the lurch. I suppose you know what it means
when rats desert the sinking ship, don&rsquo;t you? Well, we
are sinking, and away goes the first rat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came swiftly across to him and caught him by
the arm and looked into his face. &ldquo;Do you mean what
you say? Where is Brian? I won&rsquo;t believe&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;ll go
and find him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Halfway to the door his voice arrested her. &ldquo;You
may shriek the house down and you won&rsquo;t find him. He&rsquo;s
miles away. Egad! when I come to think of it&rdquo;&mdash;Mr.
Robert Carlaw scratched his chin and smiled&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s a
pretty cool hand. And I&rsquo;m not sure that it isn&rsquo;t what his
poor old father would have done under the circumstances.&rdquo;
He turned over the letter he held in his hands
and looked at it. &ldquo;And the phrasing is beautiful, quite
the sort of thing that would grace his biography, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came back slowly from the door and pointed to
the letter. &ldquo;Is that from Brian?&rdquo; she asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, still looking at it with a fond
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I see it? What does he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wise for you to see it all,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Carlaw. &ldquo;But he sends a message to you
which will probably explain matters more clearly than I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
could do.&rdquo; He turned to the letter and presently came
upon the passage he wanted. &ldquo;Ah, here we are. &lsquo;Tell
her that I think, under all the circumstances, she will have
no great cause to regret me. It is a question which has
been discussed on many occasions, and as regards the
solution of which I am still in doubt: Whether men of
genius should marry? It is, perhaps, a little late in the
day to raise the point; but my duty to a world which
demands of me my best compels me to gain experience of
both sides of every question. I have tried the one with
no very definite success, and as I hold that ordinary laws
and rules do not govern the man who is beyond all laws,
so I feel that I have a perfect right to take my life again
into my own hands and to shape it anew. You may tell
her, if you think it necessary, that I leave her as
free, from my point of view, to contract any other
alliance as I shall feel on my part. In a word, I&rsquo;&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t think, on the whole,&rdquo; added Mr. Carlaw, folding
up the letter, &ldquo;that it is necessary for you to hear any
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The face she turned to him almost frightened him;
the change in it in the past few minutes was pitiful.
&ldquo;Then there is something else?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I
the right to know that also?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;As you
will,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To put it in a few words, my son Brian,
with that irresponsibility which has ever characterized
him, and which I believe characterizes most men of brilliant
parts, has taken this sudden journey&mdash;well, not unaccompanied.
Do you follow me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded and her lips moved, although no sound
came from them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt you would,&rdquo; responded Mr. Carlaw. &ldquo;You see,
the lady&mdash;for she is a lady, in that sense&mdash;has long cherished
a great admiration for him and for his work; she
is extremely wealthy and I am not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly and made a step toward her,
for she had cried out and had closed her eyes and had
swayed blindly toward a chair. But she waved him off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
as he came near her, and sat down quietly, staring straight
in front of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, the question remains,&rdquo; went on Mr. Robert
Carlaw airily, &ldquo;what are <i>we</i> to do? Personally, I am a
Bohemian, a wanderer&mdash;some might even say a wastrel;
a cup of water and a crust will suffice for me, and I am
happy. Frankly, I prefer wine and well-cooked dishes,
but in an emergency the simpler fare will do for me.
But to be reduced, as we are now, to beggary in a moment&mdash;well,
it&rsquo;s trying to a man&rsquo;s nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we reduced to beggary?&rdquo; she asked in a low
voice, and in a tone which suggested that that was the
smallest part of the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we are; but for that we should probably
still have my erring son among us. The money being
gone, and the source from which it was derived gone
also, my poor boy lost his head. You see, it has been a
maxim of mine throughout life to walk in the softest and
shadiest places in search of the brightest flowers, and I
rather fear that my poor son has caught the trick of the
business from me. Finding that the sun has gone out in
one quarter, he naturally turns to another where it is
still shining, and where fresh flowers nod to him in a
new breeze, as it were. Really, I suppose we ought not to
blame him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he has left&mdash;left me nothing in the world?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;Not that that matters in the least; but I don&rsquo;t
quite understand what you mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear child, no man can perform impossible
feats; Brian had nothing to leave you, and therefore was
helpless in the matter. Oh, I don&rsquo;t think you should
blame Brian for that. Having nothing, he could leave
nothing; there&rsquo;s the whole thing in a nutshell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him with a puzzled expression; the
greater sorrow had slipped away for a moment, while
these commonplace things were forced upon her. &ldquo;But
Brian told me we were very rich, or at least that we had
a good income; he told me he made a lot of money with
his books.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my child, when a man&rsquo;s in love he&rsquo;ll say or do
anything. After all, Brian&rsquo;s desire was a laudable one;
his wish was to keep you from sorrow or want. His own
income was small, decidedly small; the&mdash;remainder came
from another source.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another source,&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;I seem indeed to
have been living in some world from which I am rudely
awakened. What was this mysterious income which has
gone on so long and seemed inexhaustible, and yet has
suddenly ceased? What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose, now that the thing is ended, you may
as well know everything; it can not matter very much.
My nephew, whom I believe you know&mdash;of course you
know him&mdash;has been generous enough, having a large private
income of his own far beyond his wants, to provide
Brian with&mdash;well, with considerable sums&mdash;really, I believe,
out of an admiration he possessed for Brian&rsquo;s work.
That&rsquo;s the whole matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; She had risen suddenly to her feet
and was covering her face with her hands; the man stood
still, somewhat amazed, watching her. Presently she
took her hands away, and he saw with more amazement
that her face was wet. She came toward him quickly,
and had a difficulty at first in getting out her words; some
of the phrases were broken into by little hysterical laughs.
&ldquo;Of course, all this comes&mdash;comes as something of a surprise&mdash;almost
a shock&mdash;to me. You&rsquo;ve told it all&mdash;all so
suddenly that I haven&rsquo;t been able to think of it&mdash;to get
it clearly. Tell me one thing: how long has this robbery
been going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robbery! Really, my dear child, you use the wrong
term. There has been no question of robbery; all the
payments that have been made have been made freely and
willingly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can believe that,&rdquo; she said softly, and covered
her face again. &ldquo;But how long has it been going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe we were in temporary difficulties soon
after my young nephew left school. My eccentric sister&mdash;generous
soul&mdash;had placed large sums of money in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
boy&rsquo;s hands, while we were actually on the verge of starvation.
Comethup came to our rescue; he has been coming
to our rescue periodically ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then this house, these pictures, the carriage in
which I ride, this dress&rdquo;&mdash;she struck herself fiercely on
the breast&mdash;&ldquo;all were bought with&mdash;with his money? Is
that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Practically, that <i>is</i> so. You see, poetry, however
good and however conducive to fame, is practically a drug
in the market; there is no great income to be made from
it. Consequently, other means of support became necessary
and were fortunately at hand. I don&rsquo;t suppose
Brian&rsquo;s personal income has been a tenth part of what we
have been spending. That&rsquo;s the melancholy fact. And
now everything has gone from us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I understand that we&mdash;these payments have
ceased?&rdquo; she said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Entirely ceased. My poor nephew is no longer in
a position to assist us; he has lost his aunt&rsquo;s favour, and
like ourselves has been cast upon an unsympathetic
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know how that happened?&rdquo; she asked
drearily.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw decided under the delicate circumstances
to lie. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I do not know.
My worthy sister is, as I have suggested, eccentric, and
one never knows from hour to hour what whim or fancy
may seize her. No, I am not aware of the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So what I&rsquo;m to understand is this: that the man who
has helped us so long being now himself a beggar, we are
reduced to beggary; and Brian&rdquo;&mdash;her voice broke and
she turned her head away&mdash;&ldquo;Brian seeks some one else
who can support him. Are those the facts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crudely, those are the facts,&rdquo; replied Mr. Carlaw.
&ldquo;I have been told that it is useless to attempt to govern
genius by the ordinary laws to which smaller humanity is
subject, and so we must take my misguided son as we
find him and make the best of him. From the world&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
point of view he has, like his unfortunate parent, gone to
the devil&mdash;but the world in his case will not, I think,
judge him hardly. The question that remains for us is,
What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; she echoed, starting up and
facing him scornfully. &ldquo;What shall we do? Hide ourselves&mdash;hide
ourselves from the sight of every honest man
and every honest woman! Creep through desert places
where no one can see us; keep out of the sight of those
who might glean the faintest idea of our story. What
shall we do? You have carried a brave face to the world
while your hands were filled with money wrung from a
generous-hearted boy, who did it&mdash;God help us all!&mdash;from
a motive you wouldn&rsquo;t understand if you knew it.
And you ask me what we shall do! You are an old man,
and I a woman suddenly grown old; you have but few
years before you&mdash;I, unfortunately, may have a long lifetime.
Yet, if I could live through all the ages, and
could get that best gift that man or woman may claim,
the loss of memory, I could not wash out the stain of
this thing. That is absolutely unforgivable. That I
should have been kept in ignorance of it; that I should
have taken the hand of this good fellow in friendship
and smiled into his eyes while he fed and clothed
me! Have you sunk so low that you can&rsquo;t feel that&mdash;can&rsquo;t
understand it? Can you stand there and smile
at me, knowing that you&rsquo;ve stripped from me everything
that made my life&mdash;my love&mdash;my self-respect&mdash;my
very honour? And then you ask me what I shall
do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Carlaw was somewhat abashed. He had
expected to meet tears and lamentations; he had not
thought that she would look upon the matter in this
light, or that she could find it in her heart to address such
words to him. &ldquo;I beg, whatever you do,&rdquo; he said somewhat
nervously, &ldquo;I beg that you will do nothing rash;
that you will think seriously of the position and review it
with calm deliberation. Frankly, I am in that position
that it is impossible for me to assist you; if I obtain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
cup of water and the crust to which I have referred I
shall consider myself fortunate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want help from no one,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I only want
to go away and hide myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; he replied, and shrugged his shoulders
and left her. He reflected, as he went to his own room,
on the ingratitude of all created beings, and of women
in particular, and decided after much thought that his
best plan for his own future self-preservation would be
to follow Brian and endeavour to get again into his good
graces. He saw with some penetration that Brian was
the only man now left who had any money at his command.</p>

<p>She sat for a long time after he had left her, trying
to get the whole terrible business into an ordinary compass
in order that she might understand it. It was a
thing so gigantic and so terrible and so unexpected that it
was difficult for her to realize it completely. All that
she had ever hoped and prayed for&mdash;all her world, in
fact&mdash;had been swept away in an instant; she wanted, as
she had said, to go and hide herself and strive to forget
it. Left alone with all her dreams shattered, with the
man in whom her faith had been centred standing before
her in a mental picture, debased and fallen and degraded,
she dared not look upon the world&mdash;scarcely
dared to think about the matter.</p>

<p>It was quite late in the evening when, taking nothing
with her, and glancing to right and left like a guilty
thing that fears to be seen, she crept out of the house and
away into the streets. In the hours that had passed since
she had heard the story she had prayed once or twice
for death; had hoped that some sudden madness might
come upon her which should cut off the years as by a
magician&rsquo;s knife, and leave her, a little lonely child again,
in the garden of her father&rsquo;s house. And with that
prayer came a new thought&mdash;a sudden wish to see the
place again.</p>

<p>It was impossible that her mind could be left entirely
blank or her heart quite vacant; with everything that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
had believed in and trusted stripped away from her, her
thoughts went back to Comethup, and raised him a silent,
splendid figure blessing and helping her through all these
years during which she had flouted him and set him
aside. Beside that splendid figure the man she had
dreamed she loved faded into nothingness; she felt that,
if only for an hour, she must get back to the old place,
where she had broken his heart and left him; must get
back, if only to cry her own heart out.</p>

<p>She had a little money with her, and was fortunate in
catching the last train, which would take her to within a
few miles of the old town. Fatigue meant nothing to
her; she alighted at Deal and set out to walk, hurrying
along the road and whispering his name as she ran, and
crying incoherently to him to forgive her.</p>

<p>The town was dark and silent when she reached it.
She was in a mood to sit down and cry&mdash;half from weariness,
half from delight at being in the old familiar streets
again. She hastened on toward the garden and went in,
swaying a little from weakness as she passed over the
fallen gate and up the dreary avenue. There, under the
balcony where she had parted from him, she stood still,
looking up at the deserted house and weeping bitterly.
And suddenly from among the shadows of the trees there
stole out the figure of a man.</p>

<p>He came forward slowly with his arm stretched out;
as the moonlight fell upon his face she saw that it was
the old shoemaker, Medmer Theed, and that he was smiling
upon her. The sight of one friendly face in that
dark and desolate garden struck a chord in her that had
not been wakened before; she caught his hands and burst
into a sudden passion of tears.</p>

<p>The old man drew her gently to his breast, and laid
her head there and whispered soothingly to her. &ldquo;My
child, my baby!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They shall not harm you.
I knew you would come back; I have waited here so long&mdash;so
long! Yet the nights have been full of dreams of
you; the wind has whispered your name among the trees;
the birds seeking their nests have cried to me, &rsquo;She will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
come back; when all else desert her, she will come back
to you.&rsquo; And see, they were right, and all the waiting is
ended. Just as I dreamed that she came back to me&mdash;she
who died&mdash;so the child I loved has returned, and all
my watching is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take me away! Take me away, and hide me,&rdquo; she
cried, clinging to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, they shall not find you, child. The dreams
have come true at last, or almost true. They shall not
find you; we will hide you safely in the old place you
knew as a child, and I will watch over you. Come&mdash;they
shall not find you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unresisting, she submitted to be half led, half carried
from the garden and along the deserted streets to the old
man&rsquo;s house. There, with his arm still fast about her,
he unlocked the door and led her in and took her to
an inner room; with the gentleness of a woman he laid
her down there and covered her up. In a few moments,
from sheer weariness, she was fast asleep.</p>

<p>It happened that night that Captain Garraway-Kyle,
feeling restless and lonely, had thrown his old-fashioned
military cloak about him and had gone for a long walk.
Coming back very late he paused for a moment near the
old archway through which the shop of the shoemaker was
reached, and after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation passed through
and stopped before the shop. The captain was a man of
few friends, and had been in the habit, since his first
conversation with old Medmer Theed, of going to the
place sometimes in the evening for the sake of company.
On this occasion, feeling for some indefinite reason
more lonely even than usual, and seeing a light
gleaming through the shutters, he knocked softly at the
door. In a moment it was opened, and he saw the old
man, bearing a candle, standing within the doorway. The
captain civilly wished him good-evening and made as if
to enter in the ordinary way. For the moment, however,
the old shoemaker barred his entrance; then, stepping
aside, with a grunt, he somewhat churlishly admitted
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very late, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;but
I saw a light, and guessed you were not in bed. Are
you alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Theed. &ldquo;What did you expect?
Am I not always alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; replied the captain somewhat surprised
at his tone. &ldquo;Like yourself, I am a lonely man,
and am glad sometimes to find a fellow-creature to whom
I can talk.&rdquo; He had entered the little low-roofed shop
by this time and had seated himself upon a bench. &ldquo;Why,
it&rsquo;s quite cold to-night, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>He had spoken in his usual quick, rather highly
pitched voice, and suddenly the shoemaker raised a warning
forefinger, and glanced toward the door at the back of
the shop. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he whispered softly.</p>

<p>The captain looked at him in amazement. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
very sorry,&rdquo; he said, lowering his voice. &ldquo;I had no idea
that there was any one in here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sleeping,&rdquo; whispered the old man eagerly.
&ldquo;When the winds sang of her in the trees, and the trees
bent to each other to whisper of her coming, she came
suddenly to me in the old place where I had waited so
long; she came weeping, as I had dreamed she would
come, and crying to me to take her away and hide her.
And so I brought her here, that none may find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said the captain in a startled
whisper. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She came to me as a little child; was sent to me by
God for my comfort. Often and often she has sat where
you sit now while I worked, and has made the dreams I
dreamed about her more real than my waking life. But
they shall not find her&mdash;they shall not find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Linda!&rdquo; whispered the captain, and caught the
other&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;What brings her here; what is the meaning
of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know; I have not asked,&rdquo; replied the shoemaker.
&ldquo;I know only that she came weeping, as I had
dreamed she would come; weeping as that other child
who grew to be a woman must have wept, as all women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
are born to weep. But she is safe now; they shall not
find her again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see her,&rdquo; whispered the captain, rising from
the bench on which he sat and approaching the door of
the inner room. &ldquo;Remember, I loved her too; let me
see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment old Medmer Theed stood jealously before
the door; then drew aside somewhat reluctantly, and
pushed it open and signed to the captain to follow him.
Treading cautiously, they went in and stood beside the
little rough bed on which she lay. She was still sleeping
soundly, and as the captain bent over her he saw that
there were traces of tears still on her face. After a few
moments they came out again into the shop.</p>

<p>The captain felt that nothing could be done that
night; he knew nothing of what story she had to tell or
of what had happened. Perplexed and troubled, he bade
the old shoemaker good-night, and set off for his cottage.
Medmer Theed barred the door and then, after glancing
in again for a moment to see that his charge was safely
sleeping, laid himself down across the threshold of the
room and rested there all night, although he scarcely slept
at all. Every slightest noise in the street seemed to his
excited imagination the sound of pursuit, and he half
sprang up more than once, watchful and eager to defend
her. When day came at last he did not unfasten the
shop as usual, but left the shutters still closed, so that
the only lights in the place were two long streams of sunlight
which poured through certain round holes in them.
His work was left untouched, and he hovered about between
the inner room and the shop, pressing food upon
&rsquo;Linda and treating her in every way with more than a
woman&rsquo;s tenderness.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Linda for her part sat throughout the day with her
chin propped in her palms, thinking. How much she reviewed
in those hours it would be impossible to say; in
what new and better light she saw many events she had
not fully understood before. Everything had been torn
from her; she had to start her life again, to build up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
new hopes and new dreams and new beliefs; but she could
not do that yet. Years seemed to have passed since the
previous day; she had for the first time in her life taken
great strides within a few hours&mdash;been shaken suddenly
to an understanding of what her life had been as she had
never understood it at any other time.</p>

<p>The captain came down to the shop during the day,
but finding it closed he hesitated to knock and went away
again. In truth, the captain was puzzled what to do: to
leave her alone with the strange old creature Medmer
Theed, to leave her to face and fight against the desperate
trouble which had driven her there, seemed impossible;
and yet as the captain had never seen her since the day
of her flight with Brian, he hesitated now to intrude
upon her sorrow. However, when night again came
on, he set out for the shoemaker&rsquo;s shop, determined at
least to gain some tidings of her or to learn that she
was well.</p>

<p>He had a curious feeling as he walked along that some
one was following him, even trying, in a half-hesitating
fashion, to overtake him. As he turned in at the old
archway the one who followed had evidently made up
his mind, for the steps drew nearer, and before the captain
could turn his head a hand was laid on his shoulder.
He stopped and looked round, and recognized by the dim
light of the lamp above them the features of Mr. Robert
Carlaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray pardon me,&rdquo; said that gentleman in a curiously
subdued tone. &ldquo;I have taken the liberty of following
you for some distance; I was not quite sure as
to your identity, and one does not care to accost a
stranger in the street and meet with a rebuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish to see me?&rdquo; asked the captain coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;I am in such a
state of mind at the present moment that I really don&rsquo;t
know what I am doing or what I am saying. I have a
dim notion that duty has brought me here, and the
thought of duty has always been paramount with me.
Sir&rdquo;&mdash;he struck an attitude and slapped himself with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
hand on the breast&mdash;&ldquo;I am in a state verging on distraction!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain looked at him critically; he almost
thought for a moment that the man had been drinking.
But he was still more astonished when he caught the
gleam of tears in his faded eyes. &ldquo;I fear you are in
trouble,&rdquo; said the captain gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble!&rdquo; echoed the other. &ldquo;I want a new word
to describe my feelings, an entirely new word. My son
could have found the word or the phrase, and my son is
dead!&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p class="subheading">THE PLEADING OF THE CAPTAIN.</p>


<p>For a moment or two the captain stared at Robert
Carlaw in astonishment. A hundred thoughts went
dancing through his brain; he wondered if the death of
Brian might have something to do with &rsquo;Linda&rsquo;s flight
back to the old place. While he was framing some question
in his mind Mr. Carlaw broke out into a tempestuous
explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut off&mdash;cut off&mdash;in what the world would term the
midst of his sin; robbed of life in the very flower of his
manhood and his strength! Yet what a life&mdash;and ye
gods!&mdash;what a death! Even in that he was splendid;
even in that he fills the public eye. It was the very death
that the public would expect him to die; they&rsquo;ll catch
their breath when they read of it. Drowned&mdash;drowned
on a moonlight night and with his arms about a woman!
Drowned&mdash;and with twenty thousand a year in his arms!
It&rsquo;s magnificent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was weeping still, but his face literally shone with
the joy and pride of the thought; he dashed the tears
away, and with the same gesture waved his arms in triumph
toward the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But when did this happen?&rdquo; asked the captain.
&ldquo;And who was the woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was all so like him,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Robert Carlaw,
scarcely heeding the other&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;He worked
on impulse; he lived his life on impulse; he died on impulse.
This last thing alone should make him immortal.
What other man would have had the courage? What
other man would have had the frank and splendid audacity?
To desert his wife when he felt that she was no
longer what he needed; to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he deserted her, did he?&rdquo; said the captain slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; such minds do not stick at any conventional
things. He deserted her; he fled with another. The
other was rich and&mdash;so I understand&mdash;beautiful. She
had a yacht waiting to carry her and her poet away&mdash;think
of the romance of it, think of the romance of it!
They reached the yacht, it appears, and set sail for their
paradise under a moonlit sky. Imagine the scene! Then,
in the midst of it all comes grim Fate in the shape of a
lumbering coasting steamer and cuts them in two. A
survivor has already declared that he saw Brian Carlaw
and the woman go down locked in each other&rsquo;s arms.
My poor boy&mdash;he has carried himself well before the world
to the last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; asked the captain with some sternness,
&ldquo;that his wife is here, within a few yards of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not aware of it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Carlaw, glancing
about him. &ldquo;My sole reason for coming here&mdash;to this
place of his birth&mdash;and at so early a moment is because I
feel that something should be done for him; that they
should understand the loss they and the world have sustained,
and should fitly mark their grief. From whom
could the news come so appropriately as from the father
who loved him and sacrificed so much for him? That is
my real errand. But you say that she is here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the captain; &ldquo;she came here yesterday&mdash;I
suppose when she learned that he had deserted
her. She must be told of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose she must,&rdquo; replied Mr. Carlaw hurriedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
&ldquo;Of course, she takes no real or great place in
this sorrowful business; my son stands alone, and the
name of the lady with whom he died will naturally and
inevitably be linked with his. A few will be shocked;
to the majority, I trust, the position will appear appropriate.
Personally, I am sorry for the wife&mdash;but she does
not touch the story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; muttered the captain to himself.
Aloud he said, &ldquo;I must tell her, and must see
what is to be done for her, poor child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I remember you as a man of a tender nature, my
dear captain,&rdquo; said Mr. Robert Carlaw, gazing at the sky.
&ldquo;For the present I have other work on hand; it happens,
on occasion, that the dead are more important than
the living. And in the glory of my dead son, I&mdash;his unfortunate
father&mdash;may chance to cut a figure at last.&rdquo;
He started to whistle as he turned away, but remembered
himself in time, and walked with a drooping head and a
less jaunty step than usual. The captain looked after
him for a moment and then went toward the shoemaker&rsquo;s
shop. He knocked, and after some little delay was admitted
by old Theed. The captain stepped into the shop
and jerked his head in the direction of the inner room.
&ldquo;Is she sleeping?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The old man nodded. &ldquo;All day long,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she
has sat like one in a dream, scarcely seeing me; a little
time since she fell asleep, but even now her dreams are
troubled and she cries out strange things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain paced up and down the little shop nervously
for a minute or two and then turned to the shoemaker.
&ldquo;I should like to see her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have
something to say that must be told her at once&mdash;something
that should be told by a friend, lest she should
hear it from any other lips. I should like to see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medmer Theed looked at him keenly; came nearer and
laid a hand on his arm. &ldquo;Are they seeking her?&rdquo; he
asked in a whisper. &ldquo;Will they trouble her again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain looked at him, doubtful what to say or
how much to leave unsaid. &ldquo;The man who has troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
her so long,&rdquo; he replied at last, &ldquo;is dead, and will trouble
her no more. But she must be told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were a dignity and a firmness in his tones which
mastered the more ignorant man; without a word he
pushed open the inner door and motioned to the captain
to enter. As the captain stepped through, the old shoemaker
would have followed, but the captain gently signed
to him to keep back, and closed the door and was left in
the room alone with &rsquo;Linda. She was still sleeping, and
he set the light he carried on a little table near the bed,
and quite simply and noiselessly went upon his knees and
bowed his head in his hands and muttered a little prayer
to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God of the little children,&rdquo; he breathed, &ldquo;who hast
sent back to me this child whom I loved in my old age,
teach me, in thy infinite mercy, how best to tell her,
out of a heart that loves her, what her sorrow is; teach
me how best to comfort her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose from his knees and seated himself beside the
bed, and laid a lean old hand on the white one which lay
near it. She stirred softly in her sleep and opened her
eyes and looked at him&mdash;looked at him for some moments
without recognition. Then, slowly and without turning
her gaze from him, she drew nearer until she had crept
quite into his arms, until her face was hidden on his
breast. And so for a long time they remained in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little one,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you have not forgotten
your old friend, you have not forgotten the old days. A
long, long time has passed between, but in your hour of
need you have crept back quite naturally to us to find a
haven here. There, don&rsquo;t tremble; nothing shall harm
you; nothing shall come near you. You were a child
when I knew you before; dream that you are a child
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She clung to him, weeping. &ldquo;Oh, that I might!&rdquo; she
whispered. &ldquo;If I might go back and see with the clearer
eyes I have now; if I might know what I know now and
make atonement!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The time must come when we all cry that, child,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
he said. &ldquo;The time must surely come when the bravest
and the best of us would be glad if we might begin again,
seeing the way before us with clearer eyes. Listen: are
you strong enough lying here in your old friend&rsquo;s arms&mdash;are
you strong enough to hear what I shall say to
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up at him wonderingly and grasped his
hand more closely, but he dared not look at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a man whom you loved, a man you called
husband&mdash;ah, don&rsquo;t shudder; don&rsquo;t weep like that, or
you&rsquo;ll break my heart, child! Because you loved him he
holds a better place in my thoughts than he could ever
otherwise have done; because you loved him I must bear
him kindly in my remembrance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I might atone, if I might atone!&rdquo; she whispered,
and hid her face again.</p>

<p>The captain did not understand; he went on in the
same gentle tones: &ldquo;There comes a time for every man
and every woman when all blame and all praise are as
nothing to them, and pass them over; when their little
lives fade out and are judged by the standard of something
we do not understand; a time when they pass beyond
our censure and we can afford to think lightly of
their mistakes. &rsquo;Linda, do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up at him; her brows wrinkled a little as
she watched his face, but she did not speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He left you without thinking what might happen,
careless of what sorrow the world held for you. But
you can afford to forgive that now; in time you may even
learn to forget it. Your prayers or your tears can not
reach him any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You mean that he&mdash;he
is dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He is dead. He died quite suddenly and
painlessly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent for a long time; he had expected that
she would cry out&mdash;had fully anticipated a painful scene;
but this apathy was more disconcerting than anything
could have been. After a time, without looking up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
him, she asked softly: &ldquo;And Comethup? What of Comethup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is well, I believe,&rdquo; said the captain, trying to hide
his astonishment. &ldquo;I have not heard from him for some
time.&rdquo; The worthy gentleman was at a loss to understand
the strangeness of her demeanour; he cast about in
his mind for a clew to guide him, but could find none.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know that he has left his home&mdash;that he has
been cast out into the world?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>The captain forgot everything in his new astonishment.
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I had heard
nothing about this. I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now&mdash;not now,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Some other
time you will know all about it and will judge me as you
should. Leave me alone now; I want to think. Kiss me&rdquo;&mdash;she
turned up her face to his&mdash;&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t think hardly
of me, dear old friend, if you can help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kissed her and softly patted her cheek, lingered a
moment, and then, as he saw her lying with closed eyes,
stole out of the room, shutting the door behind him. With
scarcely a word to Medmer Theed he went out of the shop
and into the street, and walked back to his own place.
There, pacing up and down the little parlour, he turned
over many things in his mind, and wondered again and
again in a vague fashion what he should do; above all
things, what he should do in regard to &rsquo;Linda.</p>

<p>To leave her with the old shoemaker was obviously out
of the question, and yet what else was to be done? The
captain felt here at once the helplessness of his mere
manhood; saw that, whatever delicacy he might possess,
it was quite unequal to such an occasion as this. &ldquo;It
wants a woman,&rdquo; muttered the captain to himself; and so
started on a new train of thought.</p>

<p>The result of that particular train of thought was
that the captain, after passing a sleepless night, set off
early the next morning for London, and presented himself
within a few hours at the door of Miss Charlotte Carlaw&rsquo;s
house. He sent up his card and was at once admitted
and taken into the old woman&rsquo;s presence. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
turned her head toward him as he entered the room, and
smiled a welcome and held out her hand. The captain
took the hand in his courtly fashion and hoped that she
was well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, in better health than I ought to be, I&rsquo;ve no
doubt,&rdquo; replied the old woman. &ldquo;And what brings you
to town? Have you come like all the rest to upbraid me
for my harshness&mdash;to cry out his virtues to me? have
you come for that? Because, if you have, you will be
wiser to save your breath and say nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me begin by saying that I know nothing of the
matter,&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;and that that is not my
errand. I have certainly learned in an accidental manner
that Comethup no longer lives here; but I have heard
so much within the past few days that my poor old brain
is in a whirl, and I can think of nothing coherently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, while you collect your thoughts,&rdquo; replied Miss
Carlaw, &ldquo;I can tell you in a few words what has happened.
You were fond of the boy just as I was; believed
in him, I think, just as I did&mdash;which shows we were both
fools in that sense at least. In a word, he has been
steadily&mdash;or unsteadily&mdash;spending my money for years
past in riotous living&mdash;ever since he was a boy, in fact;
and now, to crown it all, has borrowed a large sum of
money on the understanding that he is my heir and can
pay it back when I am dead. When I&rsquo;m dead&mdash;you hear
that? That&rsquo;s the bitterest part of all; I&rsquo;d have forgiven
anything but that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been some horrible blunder,&rdquo; said the captain,
shaking his head sturdily. &ldquo;I know Comethup,
have seen him grow up since he was a little child, and I
can&rsquo;t believe that it&rsquo;s possible. There&rsquo;s some mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think so,&rdquo; replied Miss Carlaw. &ldquo;But
there&rsquo;s no doubt about it; he has admitted it. However,
we won&rsquo;t talk about it any more; I swore never to talk
about it again. What do you want with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay a moment,&rdquo; urged the captain. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you
tell me what has become of him or where he is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied, turning away. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
done with so far as I am concerned; in fact, he never
really lived. We&rsquo;ll speak of him no more, please.&rdquo;
Then in a moment she lost that gentler tone and swung
round upon him fiercely. &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, man, have
some mercy! If my face tells you nothing of what I have
suffered, the agony of loneliness that has been mine during
these past weeks, then at least let my lips tell you.
I always liked you; I believe you to be a good and honourable
gentleman. Perhaps I can say to you what I
might not to another. He has spoiled my life, old though
I am, just as he has spoiled his own; can&rsquo;t you see that I
couldn&rsquo;t take him to my heart again? He refused all explanations
of what had been done with the money; stubbornly
refused to say a word about it.&mdash;There, let&rsquo;s have
done with it. Tell me what you came here for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain saw that it was useless to pursue the subject;
he sighed and turned to that newer matter. &ldquo;I
must speak of him again for a moment, although indirectly.
Do you remember a most unhappy occasion,
when you came to visit me in the hope of meeting a girl
to whom the boy was to be married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember. What of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever his after sins may have been, he behaved,
as regards that matter, with a delicacy and a consideration
for the woman who had betrayed him which was, to
my simple thought, wonderful. Even if, as you say, he
is worthless, he had that one merit of loving her sincerely
and strongly through everything; of that I am
convinced. She fled with his cousin Brian and they
were married. At the present moment she is destitute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain paused and looked at her intently to see
the effect of his words; she merely nodded to him to
proceed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her husband&mdash;a worthless fellow, I fear&mdash;appears to
have deserted her for another woman, and within a few
hours of his desertion to have been drowned at sea. She
has come back to her old home and is living under the
protection of a strange old creature, a shoemaker, who
loved her and cared for her when she was a little lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
child. Beyond that man and myself she hasn&rsquo;t a friend
in the world; there is no one to whom she can turn. She
is hallowed forever in my sight because poor Comethup
loved her; she is set apart from all other women on that
account. She is very young and, as I have said, helpless
and hopeless. Dear old friend&rdquo;&mdash;the captain made a
movement toward her&mdash;&ldquo;I want you to help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Carlaw, whose face was working
strangely, turned her head away from him and beat one
foot restlessly on the floor. &ldquo;Why should I do that?&rdquo;
she asked at last in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re a woman,&rdquo; replied the captain eagerly;
&ldquo;because&mdash;deny it if you will&mdash;you can&rsquo;t shut out the
thought of this boy we both love from your heart; because
this girl in her loneliness may appeal to you in your
loneliness, may give in time a kinder thought of him.
You must not try to persuade me that you are so hard
as you would have me believe. If you will not let me
plead for the boy himself, let me plead for the woman
he loved and lost&mdash;the woman who is friendless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent for a long time and presently sat down
in her old attitude with her hands resting on her stick
and her forehead on her hands. And the captain watched
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a good man,&rdquo; she said at last, without raising
her head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never a day, never an hour when
I do not think of him, and yet I can not call him back to
me. But if you think&mdash;and you know so much better
than I can hope to do&mdash;that it would be right and just
for me to take this girl&mdash;that it would be better for her
and better for me&mdash;then I&rsquo;ll do it. And don&rsquo;t boast of
your feelings, sir,&rdquo; she added, raising her head with something
of a return of her old manner, &ldquo;because I have my
feelings too; perhaps I&rsquo;ll even take her more warmly to
my heart because he loved her. Lord! captain, what a
blundering set of people we all are from the time we
blunder into life till the time we blunder into the grave!
I suppose I can leave all the arrangements in your hands;
I seem somehow to have lost something of my old sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
of power, something of my old strength lately; I want
some one on whom I can rely. You will tell me what to
do, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I might suggest,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;I think the
best thing for you to do would be to come down to her;
to see her and take her away with you. Will you do
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do whatever you think best,&rdquo; she replied.
And so the matter was settled.</p>

<p>The captain felt that the hardest part of his mission
had yet to be performed; but he went home that very
night and presented himself without delay before &rsquo;Linda.
To his surprise, however, he found that she was perfectly
passive, and willing to fall in with any suggestions he
made. He told her that this old lady was quite blind and
very lonely; that she had loved Comethup very dearly;
that she wanted the girl&rsquo;s companionship and help. At
the same time the captain delicately suggested that it
would be wiser for &rsquo;Linda to say nothing about Comethup
in any way; he hinted that the point was a sore one with
Miss Carlaw. &rsquo;Linda was silent for some time, and then
she looked up at him quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have done so much harm in my life,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;although
I hoped only to do good! If you think&mdash;if you
really think that I may do any good&mdash;that I may make
any atonement&mdash;I will do as you wish. I have trodden
my own wilful path so long, I will tread any other you
point out to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think this is best,&rdquo; said the captain gently.</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Carlaw came down the next day and
the captain conducted her to Medmer Theed&rsquo;s shop. The
carriage in which she had arrived was left standing in the
street outside the old archway, and the captain, without
a word, guided her through the shop and opened the inner
door and led her through. Then he came out and closed
the door, and left the two women alone. He had previously
prepared the shoemaker for what was to happen,
and the old man had accepted it without question
and appeared satisfied that she should go. As the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
stood waiting in the little shop, Medmer Theed sat
on his bench, hammering softly at the leather, as of old.</p>

<p>In the room within Miss Charlotte Carlaw had paused
for a moment with her hands stretched out gropingly.
&rsquo;Linda came timidly toward her. &ldquo;Where are you,
child?&rdquo; asked the old woman; and then their hands met
and they drew close together. Perhaps it was the touch
of a woman&rsquo;s hand that &rsquo;Linda needed just then; she suddenly
found herself drawing close to the strange old
figure, and for the first time her tears began to flow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a new beginning, child,&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw
softly. &ldquo;And, for both our sakes, will you promise
me never to speak of what is past and ended, never to
refer to any one we both knew? Will you promise that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I promise,&rdquo; whispered the girl.</p>

<p>They came out together presently into the shop; the
captain stood waiting to conduct them to the carriage.
Medmer Theed still hammered softly on his leather. The
girl went up to the shoemaker and put an arm about his
neck and whispered his name; he looked up at her with
a vacant expression, and she kissed him and murmured
some broken words of thanks. He nodded his head slowly
and went on with his work. He was still hammering
when the carriage drove away, the captain standing bareheaded
in the street, looking after them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="subheading">MEDMER MELTS A SILVER SPOON.</p>


<p>It was a clear, crisp November evening, with a touch
of frost in the air, and the captain sat in his little parlour
before a tiny fire, staring into the coals. Behind him on
the table a candle, burning in a tall, old-fashioned candle-stick,
threw a giant round-shouldered shadow of the captain
on the wall and part of the ceiling of the room. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
years had gone by since the captain stood outside
Medmer Theed&rsquo;s shop and watched the carriage roll
away&mdash;two years during which he had aged a little
more, and had gone but little beyond the confines of his
garden.</p>

<p>To-night he sat and stared into the coals and thought
a little wistfully of the past, and wondered a little what
had become of the figures that had acted out their lives
in close contact with his&mdash;some of them, indeed, in that
very room. He thought of the tiny child hugging a
puppy in its arms, standing outside his gate looking up at
him with big, frightened eyes; remembered sunny Sunday
mornings when that child had sat beside him in the
big pew in church. He sighed at last, and moved restlessly
in his chair and turned his head to look round the
familiar room.</p>

<p>There was a sudden sound of hesitating steps upon the
gravel outside, and then a cautious lifting of the latch.
The captain twisted in his chair and rose to his feet,
picked up the candle from the table, and opened the door
of the room. In the shadows of the little hallway he
saw a man standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; cried the captain, raising the light
above his head.</p>

<p>The man came forward slowly until he stood within a
yard of the light and raised his head. The captain staggered
back a step into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said the man huskily. &ldquo;I have wandered
outside this old place for an hour, fearing to come
in, but now&mdash;&mdash;I suppose you don&rsquo;t care to&mdash;to take
my hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain had put down the candle hurriedly, and
had the man by both hands and was dragging him in a
feeble, excited fashion into the room. &ldquo;Comethup&mdash;my
boy&mdash;my boy!&rdquo; he said, over and over again.</p>

<p>He got his visitor into a chair near the fire and began
to chafe his half-frozen fingers and to put back the long
hair from his face as though he had been tending a child.
And while he did so Comethup looked steadily and smilingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
at him, and the little captain smiled back at Comethup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is very good of you, sir,&rdquo; said Comethup at last,
in something of the old boyish voice. &ldquo;I might have
known you wouldn&rsquo;t turn from me, however bad you
might think I had been. And isn&rsquo;t it good just to get
back to the old room again? I&rsquo;ve been so happy in this
old room! What a little chap I was when I first came
to you! Do you remember? And what a lot has happened
since then&mdash;what a lot has happened!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been all this time, boy?&rdquo; asked the
captain, still chafing the other&rsquo;s fingers. &ldquo;Why have you
never been near me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comethup shook his head and smiled drearily. &ldquo;No,
I couldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had something of a
fight for it, you know, with no weapons to fight with.
Look at me&rdquo;&mdash;he indicated his shabby, travel-stained
dress by a gesture&mdash;&ldquo;look at me; I&rsquo;m little better than
a tramp, you know. Why&mdash;God bless your simple heart,
sir&mdash;I&rsquo;m even in hiding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In hiding?&rdquo; echoed the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You know I borrowed a lot of money, and told
the people from whom I borrowed it that I was my aunt&rsquo;s
heir. Well, it turned out I wasn&rsquo;t; they haven&rsquo;t been
able to get their money back, and I haven&rsquo;t been able to
pay the interest. There are writs out against me, I believe,
and all sorts of things. Oh, what a muddle it&rsquo;s
been, every bit of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;ll let me, I&rsquo;d like to rest here just for
to-night; and to-morrow, before the sun is up, I&rsquo;ll be
far away again. I&rsquo;m going abroad, going to try and
make a fresh start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there no other way?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None. I&rsquo;ve got to live somehow, and I must start
in a new world, with a clean slate. But don&rsquo;t let us talk
any more about myself; tell me all that has happened in
this long time. Poor Brian is dead, I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; replied the captain slowly, &ldquo;and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
a greater man in death than he was in life. Do you know
that they&rsquo;ve raised a statue to him in this town, the place
of his birth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard of that,&rdquo; replied Comethup. &ldquo;I saw
the statue only this evening. It&rsquo;s curious that they
should have stuck it up on the old walls where we used to
play together when we were boys, isn&rsquo;t it? It was half
dark when I saw it, but it looks very fine, and they&rsquo;ve
caught his attitude to the life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s quite like him,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;They
made a great fuss of it at the time; it was raised by
public subscription. He seems to have had a great many
admirers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me of the others,&rdquo; said Comethup. &ldquo;What of&mdash;of
&rsquo;Linda; is she well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very well. She has been living since her husband&rsquo;s
death with Miss Carlaw, your aunt; so you understand
she wants for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that!&rdquo; said Comethup fervently.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken quite a load off my mind. I&rsquo;ve thought of
her a thousand times and feared that she might be in
want and that I might not be able to help her. And my
aunt, does she&mdash;does she still think badly of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I gave her every reason to do so. There&mdash;don&rsquo;t
ask me anything about it, because I can&rsquo;t tell even you;
there are some things, you know, that one has to keep
quite to one&rsquo;s self. It&rsquo;s good to know that <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t think
so very badly of me; that you are willing to take me by
the hand again just as though all this had never happened.&rdquo;
He got up from his chair and laid his hand on
the captain&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll let me sleep in the
little room in which I slept as a child I&rsquo;ll be grateful to
you. And let us say good-bye here for the last time.
Long before you&rsquo;re awake in the morning, old friend,
I shall be gone. And I pray you, for the sake of the love
you had for me so long ago, don&rsquo;t think of me as you see
me to-night&mdash;poor and broken and an outcast; but remember
only the child you played with years and years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
ago; remember only the boy you were proud of when you
used to come and see me at school. Will you do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy or man, it makes no difference,&rdquo; said the captain;
&ldquo;I can only think of you as I have thought of you
always&mdash;as one who is nearer to my heart than any I
have met on my journey through life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before he could be prevented Comethup had caught
the old man&rsquo;s hands and had carried them swiftly to his
lips. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;God bless you! I
can go now with a lighter heart than I have carried for
a long time. Good-bye, old friend, good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They gripped hands once more, and Comethup, crying
lightly that he knew the way, stumbled out of the room
and went swiftly upstairs, leaving the captain standing
alone.</p>

<p>The captain sat down and tried to resume his
thoughts. But everything seemed to have been tumbled
about and thrust into fresh directions by the arrival of
Comethup. After a little time the old man got up and
reached down his heavy cloak and put on his hat and went
softly out. The night was fine; only the slow chiming of
the hour from the church clock struck upon his ears. He
walked through the garden and out into the deserted
streets.</p>

<p>Going along with bent head, pondering deeply, he
was brought to a sudden recollection of his surroundings
by hearing some one falter his name; he looked up with
a start and saw &rsquo;Linda before him. So surprising had
been the coming of the other visitor that he was scarcely
startled to see her suddenly there before him; he did not
even ask her the reason for her presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was coming to see you,&rdquo; she whispered as she held
his hand. &ldquo;I have been trying to make up my mind to
come to you all the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you here alone?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite alone. We are going abroad to-morrow,
and I craved permission to come down to the old place
once again. We may not be returning for years. I
wanted&mdash;oh, can&rsquo;t you understand?&mdash;I wanted just to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
creep back here again for an hour or two; to visit the
old scenes, perhaps even to dream some of the old dreams.
And so I took a little room at the inn here, where no one
seems to remember me, and I am going away quite early
in the morning. Miss Carlaw is coming down to Deal
to-morrow and I am to drive from here to meet her, and
from there we start on our travels. But I felt I could
not go away from the old place without seeing my old
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain thought of the man who slept at his cottage,
and decided at once that &rsquo;Linda must be kept away
from there. &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we shall have
to say our farewells here. It is very late, and when a
lady&rdquo;&mdash;he threw a little light laughter into his tones&mdash;&ldquo;when
a lady is staying at an inn she must keep regular
hours. I&rsquo;m glad, for your sake, that you are going
abroad. Come, let me take you back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed a little surprised at his apparent coldness,
but took the arm he offered and walked on with him.
Very little was said, but near the door of the inn she
stopped for a moment, with both hands clasped on his
arm, and looked away past him down the street. When
at last she spoke her voice was very soft and tender, and
trembled a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be a long, long time before I see you again,
dear old friend, and as this is to be our farewell there
is something&mdash;something I would like to say to you. I
seem again to-night to be a little child, just as I was in
those old days when you put your cloak about me and
hushed my weeping in your arms. I have given you, I
fear, cause to think badly of me. Will you think better
of me if I tell you that I would be glad to be a child
again, weeping in the rain, if only I might do some of the
things I have tried to do so much better? Something
else I must say before I leave you. There was a man&mdash;a
dear, good fellow&mdash;who loved me; I have thought of
him&mdash;oh, believe me&mdash;with tears, many and many a
night when I have lain awake. I fear there is no heaven
I can reach; I am afraid that every gate of any paradise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
that might be mine will be closed against me because I
deserted him when he most needed me. Even you&mdash;good,
kind friend that you are&mdash;even you don&rsquo;t know
everything. There is an image of stone over there&rdquo;&mdash;she
flung out her arm with a passionate gesture&mdash;&ldquo;I saw
it this afternoon, with its smiling face raised to the sky; I
would that my hands were strong enough to tear it down!
It mocks me where it stands&mdash;mocks the pain that rages
in my heart. If you should ever see the man who loved
me&mdash;the better man&mdash;will you tell him from me, now
that it is too late, that I learned to love him with all my
heart and soul; that I would that I might crawl to his
feet and kiss them, and tell him so. Will you tell him
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I see him,&rdquo; said the little captain, &ldquo;I will tell
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She kissed him hurriedly and hugged him in the old,
passionate, childish fashion, and ran into the inn. He
waited for a few moments and then turned away. He
was too upset by the events of the strange night to care
to go back to his own cottage; more than all, he feared, in
a vague fashion, to meet Comethup. With his hands
clasped behind him under his cloak he walked on, scarcely
knowing where he went, and found himself presently
turning in under the archway which led to the shoemaker&rsquo;s
shop. He dared not think, dared not bring himself
to the realization of the fact, that these two people
were in the same town, almost within cry of each other,
this night. He wanted to get away from the thought of it;
wanted desperately to talk to some one. He saw a light
gleaming through the shutters of Medmer Theed&rsquo;s shop,
and after hesitating for a moment knocked at the door.</p>

<p>He heard the bolt drawn inside, and the door was
cautiously opened and the old man appeared, looking
out at him. He was dressed only in his shirt and
trousers, and with his unkempt gray hair tossed about his
head looked a stranger, wilder figure even than usual.
Seeing the captain, he held the door wider open and
beckoned to his visitor to enter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in,&rdquo; he said in a mysterious whisper,
&ldquo;but let no one else come near.&rdquo; He had closed the door
by this time and shot the bolt. &ldquo;You, who love her, have
a right to be here; for we work together, you and I, for
love of her, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the captain, looking at him a little
uneasily and wondering what he meant. &ldquo;You are at
work late to-night,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very late, and with strange work.&rdquo; He suddenly
caught the captain by the arm and drew nearer to
him. &ldquo;Hush! Do you know that <i>he</i> has come back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Who
has come back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man who wronged her, the man they thought
was dead. If they had wanted to keep him dead why did
they thrust him up there for all men to see? why did
they put him there against the sky to laugh at her and
mock her and torture her afresh? Listen, and I&rsquo;ll tell
you something. Just as I watched for her, night after
night, through storm and rain and starlight, till she came
to me, so I have watched for him, night after night,
through storm and rain, till he has come back too. I tell
you they can not kill him; he is here to work harm to
her still, to wring fresh tears from her. At night, when
all men sleep, he comes down and prowls round here
searching for her, waiting for her. I&rsquo;ve seen him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain shook his hand off half angrily, half fearfully.
&ldquo;What madness is this?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The man
is dead and can trouble her no more; that is but an image
of stone, the work of men&rsquo;s hands. The man lies in his
grave, miles away from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medmer Theed shook his head obstinately and
laughed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know.
My dreams have taught me more than you could learn.
Dead or not, I tell you that his spirit has come back, and
waits there at night to work fresh evil to her. And that&rsquo;s
where my dreams and my love for her shall help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laid his hand again on the captain&rsquo;s arm and
drew him into the inner room. A bright fire burned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
the little grate, and thrust into the very heart of it was
a small crucible; the captain, drawing nearer, saw that
the handle of an old-fashioned spoon projected above the
edge of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what are you doing?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The shoemaker chuckled and softly stirred the fire.
&ldquo;There is but one way to kill a spirit,&rdquo; he whispered,
looking up at his companion. &ldquo;Lead or iron or steel
won&rsquo;t do; it wants finer stuff. Silver&rsquo;s the stuff. You
are a man of war, and might bring a regiment against
him in vain; but this little silver bullet, if it can but
reach him, will put an end to his mischief forever. See&rdquo;&mdash;he
pulled open a drawer in a little table and took out
an old-fashioned, heavy-barrelled pistol and a small instrument,
shaped almost like a pair of pincers, for moulding
bullets&mdash;&ldquo;I am all prepared. The silver is good, the
pistol aims truly. He shall not trouble her any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain, glancing at him in perplexity, saw in
his eyes a madness of determination he had not seen in
any face before; he understood that whatever wild
thought was in the old man&rsquo;s brain it would be useless
to attempt to combat it. After lingering for some minutes,
during which time the little mass of silver in the
bottom of the crucible gradually increased in bulk, he
bade the old man good-night, and went out. As he
looked back from the doorway he saw the wild old figure
still bending over the fire, laughing softly and muttering
incoherent things.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<p class="subheading">COMETHUP LEARNS THE TRUTH.</p>


<p>Quite early in the morning, almost before the gray
dawn had come stealing across the sky, &rsquo;Linda left the inn
and set out swiftly for the outer walls of the town. Some
of the old glamour of the romantic personality of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
dead man was still upon her, some faint pride in him
still remained. She wanted to see that statue which had
been raised to him, and of which she had caught a glimpse
as she drove into the town on the previous day; she
wanted to see it when no one else was there, to carry
away in her memory the thought of him as he stood thus
and looked in all men&rsquo;s eyes, and so perhaps to wipe
away the memory of the poorer, meaner thing she knew
him to have been.</p>

<p>A white, heavy mist was blowing across the marshy
lands from the sea; as she came up upon the grass-grown
old walls the mists were floating and flowing about the
statue, hiding and showing it by turns. She went close
and looked up at it for a long time.</p>

<p>The sculptor had been happy in striking the characteristic
attitude of the man. The figure stood with one
hand lightly planted on the hip and the other hanging
by the side; the head was thrown back and the face,
with the old daring, wilful smile upon it, turned toward
the sky. It was strange to see him there, high above
her, on the very spot where they had wandered and played
together as children. She turned away at last and began
slowly to retrace her steps, looking back once or twice
at the silent figure above her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard quick steps behind her and, turning
sharply, saw the figure of a man looming out of the
mist. The man came nearer with a half-stealthy movement
that frightened her. She was on the point of crying
out, and had stopped, scarcely knowing what to do,
when the man overtook her in a stride or two, and peered
into her face and cried her name. With a great feeling
of relief she put out her hand to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Medmer Theed!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Dear old
friend, you startled me for a moment; I could not distinguish
you in this mist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paid no heed to what she said; he did not even
notice the hand she held out to him. &ldquo;So he draws you
here still,&rdquo; he muttered half to himself. &ldquo;It is as I
thought; his power is still as great as ever. See&rdquo;&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
leaned toward her and peered into her face&mdash;&ldquo;your face
is white and there are tears in your eyes. But it shall
end, child; he shall trouble you no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She remembered afterward that he kept one hand behind
him, as though he held something in it&mdash;something
he did not wish her to see. Fearing that some strange,
wild thought such as had troubled him in the old days
was troubling him again, she spoke soothingly to him and
smiled. &ldquo;Indeed, there is nothing to trouble me,&rdquo; she
said lightly; &ldquo;all my troubles are ended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do you come here?&rdquo; he asked suspiciously.
&ldquo;Why should you come here except to meet him? and
why should you weep when you meet him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said, looking at him with a
puzzled expression. &ldquo;I have not come here to meet any
one; no one is awake yet, save ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! he comes only when others sleep,&rdquo; muttered the
old man. &ldquo;I was here but yesterday and saw him creeping
round here, and watching and waiting. And he has
drawn you to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you mean!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What have
you seen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pointed to the statue towering above them
through the mist, and lowered his voice to a whisper. &ldquo;I
have seen his spirit&mdash;the spirit of him they think dead&mdash;come
down in lonely hours and wait here for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; she cried, startled. &ldquo;This is only one
of your dreams; people can not come back from the dead.
Forget all about it, I beg of you; believe me, it is only
one of your dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer he suddenly gripped her arm and pointed,
with the hand that had been behind him, in the direction
of the statue; she saw that he held something in that
hand, although she could not see clearly what it was.
&ldquo;Then what is that?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;See, there he is, waiting
still!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a cry he sprang forward and dropped on one knee
in the roadway, and pointed with his arm. Another figure
had appeared from beyond the statue and was standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
before it, looking up at it&mdash;the tall figure of a man.
While &rsquo;Linda glanced from the figure back to the old man
kneeling in the roadway, she was stunned by a sudden
loud report and a blinding flash that seemed to scatter
and drive away the mist; and then, in a moment, the
figure before the statue turned swiftly round and stumbled
and flung up its arms and fell prone before it. She
ran to it and, scarcely knowing what she did, turned it
over and looked down at the face. And it was the face
of Comethup!</p>

<p>She had a dim, wild, despairing hope that she might
be dreaming; that the gray morning and the stone figure
at the foot of which she knelt, and the man whose head
was propped upon her arm, and the wild old figure standing
weeping and beating its breast beside her might all
be shadows in a dream she would wake to forget. But
when she heard the voice of the man in her arms she
knew that it was all true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Linda! God is very merciful&mdash;and all the world he
builds for us is very, very right&mdash;and very sweet. But
a moment ago, as I stood there, with nothing to hope
for&mdash;hold me closer and look into my eyes&mdash;I prayed for
death. And see&mdash;in a moment it comes&mdash;swiftly, too. I
don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t understand, but it&rsquo;s all&mdash;all very right, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we do anything? Tell
me&mdash;you are not&mdash;not really hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled up at her with the smile she knew and remembered
so well. &ldquo;We must not&mdash;must not lie to each
other now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because there is so little time. I
am dying&mdash;&mdash;No, don&rsquo;t turn your face away; keep your
arms tight about me. He did not&mdash;did not know; don&rsquo;t
let them&mdash;harm him. Quick&mdash;there is little time; tell
me&mdash;why you are here. Have you left her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going&mdash;going abroad with her. I came here to
see the old place again for the last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God is very good,&rdquo; he whispered, closing his eyes.
&ldquo;I might have died&mdash;without seeing you.&rdquo; He stirred a
little in her arms and tried weakly to thrust her away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now, you&mdash;you must go; you must leave me, dear. You
must go&mdash;back to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried, holding him closer. &ldquo;I will not
leave you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must&mdash;you must. And take him with you.
Hide him; don&rsquo;t let them harm him. Oh, why torture me
now? Do me this one&mdash;one last service. Go back&mdash;back
to her; keep this from her. Tell her&mdash;some day&mdash;that I
died&mdash;you need not&mdash;tell her&mdash;anything else. Will you
go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not, I can not!&rdquo; she cried, weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must&mdash;or you will undo&mdash;all I have tried&mdash;so
hard to do. Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; He raised his eyes
to the statue above them. &ldquo;See&mdash;he smiles above us.
You must leave me here. Here is my&mdash;resting place&mdash;here
my fitting&mdash;monument. Leave me&mdash;here.&rdquo; His eyes
were closing again; his hands were groping for hers.</p>

<p>She bent nearer to him, kissed him on the lips, and
whispered: &ldquo;Listen. I will do all you wish, because&mdash;because
I love you. Can you hear me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled and gripped her hands more tightly. Bending
to him again, she caught the whisper as she touched
his lips: &ldquo;God&mdash;is very good.&rdquo; And then his eyes closed,
and he died.</p>

<p>For a little time she sat holding him in her arms; then
resolutely&mdash;remembering her promise&mdash;she got up and
laid him gently at the foot of the statue, and caught the
old man by the hand and ran down the hill toward the
town. All was quiet. She noticed, as they went along
swiftly, that the old man, who still carried the pistol in
his hand, had lost the old strong dominant look from his
face and was weak and passive as a child. She took the
pistol from him, shuddering a little as she touched it,
and hid it in her dress; took him to the door of his shop
and thrust him in, and bade him, as she left him, be silent
and to tell no one of his dreams. As she came out into
the little street again, shaking from head to foot and
striving to master her tears, the old man ran after her.
He was smiling foolishly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I dreamt there was blood upon him; but that&mdash;that
was long ago, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; long ago,&rdquo; she whispered hurriedly. &ldquo;Go
back, and tell no one your dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortunately she had ordered a carriage very early, that
she might drive to Deal in time to meet Miss Carlaw.
She kept her veil down as she entered the inn and got
away from it as quickly as possible, refusing anything to
eat. She scarcely dared speak to any one lest she should
betray her agitation. Safely in the carriage at last, she
knew that she must pass almost within sight of the spot
where the statue stood with the dead man lying at its
foot; it seemed horrible to have to go away and leave
him there&mdash;dead&mdash;to be found by strangers. And then,
with another burst of tears, she remembered how he had
smiled as he died, and how she had promised to keep all
knowledge of it from the old woman. Humbled and
broken and afraid, she clasped her hands before her face
and prayed silently for strength to keep that promise to
him at least. She was grateful to think, for the first time,
when she reached Deal that her companion was blind and
could not see her face. Miss Carlaw, guessing perhaps that
her visit to the old place had awakened sorrowful memories,
said but little to her and left her to herself when, after
reaching Dover, they took the night boat for Calais.</p>

<p>And while most of the passengers were asleep &rsquo;Linda
crept on deck and stole to the side of the vessel and
dropped the heavy, old-fashioned pistol into the sea.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<p class="subheading">AUNT CHARLOTTE ATTENDS A CELEBRATION.</p>


<p>&ldquo;You have not yet told me why you returned so suddenly
to England,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Linda.</p>

<p>She was seated on a low stool beside Miss Charlotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Carlaw&rsquo;s chair; her head was resting against the old
woman&rsquo;s knee. Miss Carlaw, leaning in her old attitude
on her stick, had been silent for some time. The two
women had returned only the day before, quite suddenly
and unexpectedly, from the Continent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there were several reasons, my child,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been growing older within these past few months&mdash;older
not only in years but in my outlook on life, I think.
You&rsquo;ll laugh, perhaps, when I say it, but I&rsquo;ve gone
through many, many years of my life in a sort of wild
hurry, striving to get out of it&mdash;out of every hour of it&mdash;the
most that could be squeezed. If I had my time to
come again, I think&mdash;no, I am quite sure&mdash;that I should
linger a little by the roadside, as it were; perhaps in
that way I should see more of it, and should understand
more clearly the meaning of it all. The nearer we come
to the finish of it, child, the more clearly do we understand
that it is not for us to judge; not for us, in our
petty fashion, to say what is right or what is wrong.
Only at the end, when we go to Him who sent us here,
carrying in our hands the poor little fruits of what we
have done, can we know how sadly we have blundered,
how much there is that we might have done better. Look
at me, &rsquo;Linda; I started without eyes, but even that should
not have blinded me to all the better things I passed by.
And so, before it is too late, I want to do one little thing
that I have left undone; I want in all humility to make
some reparation to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reparation? To me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to you. There was a time&mdash;a long while ago&mdash;when
I thought hardly of you, because I thought you had
deceived some one I loved. Well, perhaps you judged him
better than I did; perhaps, after all, I was the poor fool
who was deceived, and you&mdash;out of that love which
teaches a woman more than anything else can do&mdash;found
the better man, after all. You remember I came to you,
pitying your loneliness, when he died, and I have been
more than recompensed by your love and devotion to me
since.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been very, very good to me,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Linda
in a low voice. &ldquo;But for you I might have been left
destitute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, we won&rsquo;t talk of that,&rdquo; said the old
woman. &ldquo;You know, since we have been abroad our good
old friend the captain has written to us more than once.
He mentioned in one of his letters to me about the statue
which had been erected to your husband. I don&rsquo;t want to
trouble you with sad memories, but it has occurred to me
that you might like to go again to the place where he
was born and to the place where they love and remember
him so well. Help me to be unselfish, child, for I
fear that I have selfishly tried to thrust out of your
memory any thought of him. I know you loved him,
and he was, perhaps, a better man than I judged
him to be. Will you forgive me if I have misjudged
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I have nothing to forgive,&rdquo; replied &rsquo;Linda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you say that out of your good heart; but I reproach
myself very much that I have not been gentler
with you&mdash;that I have not considered your grief a little
more. Now, listen to me. The captain told me in his
letter&mdash;you remember you read it to me&mdash;he told me that
on the anniversary of Brian Carlaw&rsquo;s birth there was
going to be a great celebration; that the people of the
little town were going to put wreaths and flowers at the
foot of the statue; that many celebrated people who had
known and loved and admired him in life would be there
to show their respect for his memory. And that has
brought me back to England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;Linda sat quite still, listening. Before her mental
vision passed a picture of a man lying dying at the foot
of that statue; a man who had willingly and cheerfully
given all he possessed in life for her; a man who had
thought that God was good because the woman who had
cast him aside kissed his lips at the last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, my dear child,&rdquo; went on the unconscious old
woman, &ldquo;I have made up my mind that we will go down
there at the time of this celebration, and you shall take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
your place as you should by the memorial of the man you
loved. That is only fair and just and right; that has
brought me back to England. Come, tell me that it will
make you happy to go back to the old place again, to feel
some pride&mdash;as you must feel&mdash;in the man whom all
others are honouring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think&mdash;I fear the journey would be too much
for you,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Linda, striving to steady her voice. &ldquo;Indeed,
you must not do this for my sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Carlaw. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve set my
heart upon it, and I shall be bitterly disappointed if you
don&rsquo;t carry out my wishes. You must be proud of him,
and it will take the keenest edge off your sorrow and make
you think kindly of him if you go. I am going to have
my own way in this, I can assure you. We&rsquo;ll go down together
to the grave of the man you love, for I suppose
they buried him there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;Linda did not answer. A sudden new thought had
come into her head&mdash;a thought that brought a quick
flush to her cheek and filled her eyes with tears. &ldquo;It
shall be as you wish,&rdquo; she said after a pause.</p>

<p>The celebration of which the captain had written&mdash;the
anniversary of Brian Carlaw&rsquo;s birth&mdash;was three days
later; the two women went down late on the day before,
and secured rooms at the inn at which Miss Charlotte
Carlaw had previously stopped. Early the following
morning, after they had breakfasted, they set out on foot
for the place; for Miss Carlaw had said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have no
ostentation about the matter; and we&rsquo;ll get there early,
before the other people arrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their walk was a short one; the old blind woman,
leaning on &rsquo;Linda&rsquo;s arm, was led through a gate and then
found her feet walking softly on grass; on the sweet
summer air the scent of roses was borne pleasantly. &ldquo;A
sweet and pleasant place,&rdquo; she murmured as they
walked on.</p>

<p>They went some little distance farther and then
&rsquo;Linda stopped. &ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;The man I loved sleeps here.&rdquo; The arm on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Miss Carlaw leaned seemed to tremble, and she thought
that the girl was weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very quiet it all is!&rdquo; said Miss Carlaw in a
hushed voice. &ldquo;I can only hear the twitter of the birds
and the rustle of the wind in the leaves. The people,
where are the people? Has no one arrived yet? Please
remember that I am blind, dear; you must be eyes for
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; the people are not here; we are quite alone,&rdquo;
said &rsquo;Linda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the statue; describe the statue to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a statue that only I can see,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Linda
slowly; &ldquo;ever since he died I have seen it towering to
the very heavens, putting me to shame. It is the statue
of a great and good man&mdash;a man so splendid in one purpose
and one hope and one faith that all other men sink
into nothingness beside him. And in the eyes&mdash;oh, can
I ever forget them?&mdash;in the eyes there is a light of such
love, such goodness, such forgiveness, that they burn forever
into my soul, until I try to close my own to shut the
light of them out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Carlaw, wondering and trembling, made a sudden
step forward and stumbled over something; she recoiled
and caught &rsquo;Linda&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;What place is this?&rdquo;
she whispered. &ldquo;That was a grave I stumbled upon.
Where have you brought me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the grave of the man I loved,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Linda, weeping.
&ldquo;There is no statue here&mdash;not even a headstone;
no crowds come here to worship. The only wreath upon
the grave is that of a few humble flowers twined by the
hands of an old soldier who loved him. This is the grave
of the man I loved&mdash;the grave of Comethup Willis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Carlaw began to tremble and her hands
went up falteringly to her lips. &ldquo;What is this? What
do you mean? Why have you brought me here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To right a wrong&mdash;to tell an old, sad story that
should have been told long since. Sit down here; it is
a quiet place, wherein he wandered as a little child; he
sleeps soundly now beside those who loved him. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
thought that he was wild and reckless, that he spent your
money shamefully, that he traded upon the fact that he
might one day expect it all. Do you know on whom that
money was spent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; tell me,&rdquo; faltered the old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For years and years he was robbed by the man I
thought the best on earth, and by that man&rsquo;s father.
When he was but a boy, travelling with you on the Continent,
those two&mdash;father and son&mdash;were following him
from place to place, preying upon him&mdash;living upon
him. They had nothing of their own. The very money
that enabled Brian to fly with me and to marry me&mdash;oh,
the bitter, bitter shame of it!&mdash;was wrung from the man
who loved me. I had nothing, and Brian earned scarcely
anything at all; I lived in a fool&rsquo;s paradise. The very
dress I wore, the food I ate, everything was bought with
his money. You have told me how he borrowed a large
sum of money, and how you discarded him for it. That
money was borrowed when extravagance had taken all
that Comethup had and when he feared I might come
to want. I have tried to tell you this again and again,
although I only knew it from your lips a few weeks ago;
they kept me in ignorance until the very last of what
the true facts of the case were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Miss Charlotte Carlaw was
rocking herself to and fro and moaning fitfully. &ldquo;Is
this&mdash;is this true?&rdquo; she asked at last in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all true,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Linda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is he dead? Can I never&mdash;never take him in
my arms again; never whisper to him how sorry I am?
Tell me, how did he die?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He died quite&mdash;quite suddenly. He was killed. He
was mistaken for&mdash;for some one else by a man who was
mad, a man who mercifully forgot all about it afterward
and whose crime was never discovered. But you will like
to know that he died in my arms, that I was able to tell
him at the last what had been in my heart so long&mdash;that
I loved him. I was able to kiss him&mdash;and he died in my
arms, smiling, and saying that God was very good. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
have written&mdash;a long time ago&mdash;and told his old friend
the captain all this, so that the captain might think well
of him. And that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman was kneeling beside the grave. &ldquo;Oh,
my boy, my boy,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;dear Prince Charming,
if you can hear me now, forgive an old woman who
loved you with all her heart and soul, and who did not
understand until it was too late.&mdash;And, oh, most merciful
God,&rdquo; she added, raising her face toward the sky,
&ldquo;I thank thee that Prince Charming lives again&mdash;that
thou hast given him back to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All was quiet and restful about them; the birds twittered
softly among the branches, and the scent of the
roses floated to them from the garden of the little cottage
against the wall of the church&mdash;the roses among
which poor Comethup had wandered and dreamed his
dreams as a little child.</p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;In their &lsquo;Town and Country Library,&rsquo; as it is known familiarly, the
Messrs. Appleton have been remarkably successful both in preserving a
good standard and in the matter of popularity. Presumably this is one of
the very few efforts of the kind which have been successful for more than a
few months. And we think the secret of continued success lies in the discrimination
used in selecting tales that are clean, pure, and withal of interest
to the average reader&rsquo;s intelligence; and, furthermore, to the fact that the
editors have been using American stories more and more frequently.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New
York Mail and Express.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;The percentage of excellence maintained throughout has been extraordinary.
It is probably within bounds to say that no other list of legitimate

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Mr. Hope has never given more sustained proof of his cleverness than in
&lsquo;The King&rsquo;s Mirror.&rsquo; In elegance, delicacy, and tact it ranks with the best of
his previous novels, while in the wide range of its portraiture and the subtlety
of its analysis it surpasses all his earlier ventures.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Spectator.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Mr. Anthony Hope is at his best in this new novel. He returns in some
measure to the color and atmosphere of &lsquo;The Prisoner of Zenda.&rsquo; ... A
strong book, charged with close analysis and exquisite irony; a book full of
pathos and moral fiber&mdash;in short, a book to be read.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Chronicle.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;A story of absorbing interest and one that will add greatly to the author&rsquo;s
reputation.... Told with all the brilliancy and charm which we have come

<p class="booktitle">The Chronicles of Count Antonio.</p>

<p>With Photogravure Frontispiece by S. W. Van Schaick. 12mo.
Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;No adventures were ever better worth recounting than are those of Antonio
of Monte Velluto, a very Bayard among outlaws.... To all those whose
pulses still stir at the recital of deeds of high courage, we may recommend this
book.... The chronicle conveys the emotion of heroic adventure, and is
picturesquely written.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Daily News.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;It has literary merits all its own, of a deliberate and rather deep order....
In point of execution &lsquo;The Chronicles of Count Antonio&rsquo; is the best work
that Mr. Hope has yet done. The design is clearer, the workmanship more
elaborate, the style more colored.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<p>New edition, uniform with &ldquo;The Chronicles of Count Antonio.&rdquo;
12mo. Cloth, $1.25.</p>

just as full of wit, and of what nowadays some persons like better than wit&mdash;allusiveness&mdash;as
any of his stories. It is saturated with the modern atmosphere;
is not only a very clever but a very strong story; in some respects, we
think, the strongest Mr. Hope has yet written.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Speaker.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;A very remarkable book, deserving of critical analysis impossible within

constructed with the proverbial art that conceals, but yet allows itself to be
enjoyed by readers to whom fine literary method is a keen pleasure.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London

<p><i><span class="dropcap">D</span>AVID HARUM.</i> A Story of American Life. By
<span class="smcap">Edward Noyes Westcott</span>. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p class="adblurb" style="clear:both;">&ldquo;Mr. Westcott has done for central New York what Mr. Cable, Mr. Page, and
Mr. Harris have done for different parts of the South, and what Miss Jewett and Miss
Wilkins are doing for New England, and Mr. Hamlin Garland for the West....
&lsquo;David Harum&rsquo; is a masterly delineation of an American type.... Here is life with
all its joys and sorrows.... David Harum lives in these pages as he will live in the
mind of the reader.... He deserves to be known by all good Americans; he is one
of them in boundless energy, in large-heartedness, in shrewdness, and in humor.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Critic.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Thoroughly a pure, original, and fresh American type. David Harum is a
character whose qualities of mind and heart, eccentricities, and dry humor will win for
his creator notable distinction. Buoyancy, life, and cheerfulness are dominant notes.
In its vividness and force the story is a strong, fresh picture of American life. Original
and true, it is worth the same distinction which is accorded the <i>genre</i> pictures of
peculiar types and places sketched by Mr. George W. Cable, Mr. Joel Chandler
Harris, Mr. Thomas Nelson Page, Miss Wilkins, Miss Jewett, Mr. Garland, Miss
French, Miss Murfree, Mr. Gilbert Parker, Mr. Owen Wister, and Bret Harte....
A pretty love story also adds to the attractiveness of the book, that will be appreciated
at once by every one who enjoys real humor, strong character, true pictures of life, and
work that is &lsquo;racy of the soil.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Mr. Westcott has created a new and interesting type.... The character sketching
and building, so far as David Harum is concerned, is well-nigh perfect. The book
is wonderfully bright, readable, and graphic.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;The main character ought to become familiar to thousands of readers, and will
probably take his place in time beside Joel Chandler Harris&rsquo;s and Thomas Nelson
Page&rsquo;s and Miss Wilkins&rsquo;s creations.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago Times-Herald.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;We give Edward Noyes Westcott his true place in American letters&mdash;placing
him as a humorist next to Mark Twain, as a master of dialect above Lowell, as a
descriptive writer equal to Bret Harte, and, on the whole, as a novelist on a par with
the best of those who live and have their being in the heart of hearts of American
readers. If the author is dead&mdash;lamentable fact&mdash;his book will live.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Item.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;True, strong, and thoroughly alive, with a humor like that of Abraham Lincoln
and a nature as sweet at the core. The spirit of the book is genial and wholesome, and
the love story is in keeping with it.... The book adds one more to the interesting
list of native fiction destined to live, portraying certain localities and types of American
life and manners.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Literary World.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;A notable contribution to those sectional studies of American life by which our
literature has been so greatly enriched in the past generation.... A work of unusual
merit.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Press.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;One of the few distinct and living types in the American gallery.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>St. Louis
Globe-Democrat.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;The quaint character of &lsquo;David Harum&rsquo; proves to be an inexhaustible source of
amusement.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening Post.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;It would be hard to say wherein the author could have bettered the portrait he
sets before us.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Providence Journal.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Full of wit and sweetness.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Baltimore Herald.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Merits the heartiest and most unequivocal praise.... It is a pleasure to call the
reader&rsquo;s attention to this strong and most original novel, a novel that is a decided and
most enduring addition to American literature.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Saturday Evening Gazette.</i></p>

author of &ldquo;Mona Maclean, Medical Student,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fellow Travellers,&rdquo;
etc. 12mo, cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p class="adblurb" style="clear:both;">&ldquo;&lsquo;Windyhaugh&rsquo; shows an infinitely more mature skill and more subtle humor than
&lsquo;Mona Maclean&rsquo; and a profounder insight into life. The psychology of Dr. Todd&rsquo;s
remarkable book is all of the right kind; and there is not in English fiction a more
careful and penetrating analysis of the evolution of a woman&rsquo;s mind than is given in
Wilhelmina Galbraith; but &lsquo;Windyhaugh&rsquo; is not a book in which there is only one
&lsquo;star&rsquo; and a crowd of &lsquo;supers.&rsquo; Every character is limned with a conscientious care
that bespeaks the true artist, and the analytical interest of the novel is rigorously kept
in its proper place and is only one element in a delightful story. It is a supremely
interesting and wholesome book, and in an age when excellence of technique has
reached a remarkable level, &lsquo;Windyhaugh&rsquo; compels admiration for its brilliancy of
style. Dr. Todd paints on a large canvas, but she has a true sense of proportion.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Blackwood&rsquo;s
Magazine.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;For truth to life, for adherence to a clear line of action, for arrival at the point toward
which it has aimed from the first, such a book as &lsquo;Windyhaugh&rsquo; must be judged
remarkable. There is vigor and brilliancy. It is a book that must be read from the
beginning to the end and that it is a satisfaction to have read.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Journal.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Its easy style, its natural characters, and its general tone of earnestness assure its
author a high rank among contemporary novelists.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;A pleasure in store for you if you have not read this volume. The author has
given us a thoroughly natural series of events, and drawn her characters like an artist.

<p class="booktitle">The Log of a Sea-Waif.</p>

<p>Being Recollections of the First Four Years of my Sea Life.
Illustrated. Uniform Edition. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p class="adblurb">The brilliant author of &ldquo;The Cruise of the Cachalot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Idylls of the
Sea&rdquo; presents in this new work the continuous story of the actual experiences
of his first four years at sea. In graphic and picturesque phrases he has sketched
the events of voyages to the West Indies, to Bombay and the Coromandel coast,
to Melbourne and Rangoon. Nothing could be of more absorbing interest
than this wonderfully vivid account of foks&rsquo;l humanity, and the adventures and
strange sights and experiences attendant upon deep-sea voyages. It is easy to see
in this book an English companion to our own &ldquo;Two Years before the Mast.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="booktitle">Idylls of the Sea.</p>

<p>12mo. Cloth, $1.25.</p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;The &lsquo;deep-sea wonder and mystery&rsquo; which Kipling found in Frank T.
Bullen&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cruise of the Cachalot&rsquo; is appreciable again in this literary mate&rsquo;s
new book, &lsquo;Idylls of the Sea.&rsquo; We feel ourselves tossed with him at the
mercy of the weltering elements,&rdquo; etc.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Record.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Amplifies and intensifies the picture of the sea which Mr. Bullen had
already produced.... Calm, shipwreck, the surface and depths of the sea,
the monsters of the deep, superstitions and tales of the sailors&mdash;all find a place
in this strange and exciting book.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago Times-Herald.</i></p>

<p class="booktitle">The Cruise of the Cachalot.</p>

<p>Round the World after Sperm Whales. Illustrated. 12mo.
Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;It is immense&mdash;there is no other word. I&rsquo;ve never read anything that
equals it in its deep-sea wonder and mystery, nor do I think that any book before
has so completely covered the whole business of whale fishing, and, at the same
time, given such real and new sea pictures. I congratulate you most heartily.
It&rsquo;s a new world you&rsquo;ve opened the door to.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Rudyard Kipling.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Written with racy freedom of literary expression and luxuriant abundance
of incident, so that &lsquo;The Cruise of the Cachalot&rsquo; becomes a story of fascinating
vividness which thrills the reader and amuses him. The volume is no less enthralling?
than &lsquo;Two Years before the Mast,&rsquo; and higher praise can not be
accorded to a story of the sea.... A book of such extraordinary merit
seldom comes to hand.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Press.</i></p>

<p>A Story of the Great Burlington Strike. 12mo. Cloth, $1.25.</p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Mr. Warman holds a unique position among our tellers of tales, since he
alone is a practical railroad man, who knows the work, and has done it, in all
its details.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Mail and Express.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Plenty of close-range photographs, interior views, of the great Burlington
strike are to be found in Cy Warman&rsquo;s book.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Times.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;It has the great virtue of being a plain story plainly told by one who
knows. Whatever other impression it may convey to the reader, it conveys
most strongly the impression of truth. And this plain truth, told in a plain
way, is a terrible thing. One can feel all the way through that half the tale&mdash;and
perhaps the worst half&mdash;is left untold, yet such as stands in print is
sufficient, and to the reader who cares for something more than the superficial
adventurous incident of the book it will not be without its instructive
influence.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Denver Republican.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Told with all the freshness and vividness of an eyewitness.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia

<p class="booktitle">The Story of the Railroad.</p>

<p>Illustrated. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Far more interesting than the average novel.... Mr. Warman&rsquo;s
volume makes us hear and feel the rush of modern civilization. It gives us
also the human side of the picture&mdash;the struggles of the frontiersman and his
family, the dismay and cruel wrath of the retreating savage, the heroism of
the advance guard of the railway builders, and the cutthroat struggles of competing
lines. He does not deal greatly with statistics, but the figures he uses
help make up the stunning effect of gigantic enterprise. There is not a dull
page in the book.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Evening Post.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Intensely interesting&mdash;a history that reads like a romance, and compared
with whose marvelous story indeed most modern romances will seem spiritless
and tame.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Charleston News and Courier.</i></p>

certainly has a unique power.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;In &lsquo;The Mormon Prophet&rsquo; Miss Lily Dougall has told, in strongly dramatic
form, the story of Joseph Smith and of the growth of the Church of the Latter-Day
Saints, which has again come prominently before the public through the election of a
polygamist to Congress.... Miss Dougall has handled her subject with consummate
skill.... She has rightly seen that this man&rsquo;s life contained splendid material for a
historical novel. She has taken no unwarranted liberties with the truth, and has succeeded
in furnishing a story whose scope broadens with each succeeding chapter until
the end.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Mail and Express.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Mormonism is not ordinarily regarded as capable of romantic treatment, but in
the hands of Miss Dougall it has yielded results which are calculated to attract the
general public as well as the student of psychology.... Miss Dougall has handled a
difficult theme with conspicuous delicacy; the most sordid details of the narrative are
redeemed by the glamour of her style, her analysis of the strangely mixed character of
the prophet is remarkable for its detachment and impartiality, while in Susannah Halsey
she has given us a really beautiful study of nobly compassionate womanhood. We certainly
know of no more illuminative commentary on the rise of this extraordinary sect
than is furnished by Miss Dougall&rsquo;s novel.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Spectator.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Miss Dougall may be congratulated both on her choice of a subject for her new
book and on her remarkably able and interesting treatment of it.... A fascinating
story, which is even more remarkable and more fascinating as a psychological study.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The

<p class="adblurb" style="clear:both;">&ldquo;&lsquo;A Herald of the West&rsquo; is a romance of our history which has not been surpassed
in dramatic force, vivid coloring, and historical interest.... In these days when the

some great wrong.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>San Francisco Chronicle.</i></p>

<p class="center">By S. R. CROCKETT.</p>

<p class="center small">Uniform edition. Each, 12mo, cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p><i><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE STANDARD BEARER.</i> An Historical
Romance.</p>

<p class="adblurb" style="clear:both;">&ldquo;Mr. Crockett&rsquo;s book is distinctly one of <i>the</i> books of the year. Five months of
1898 have passed without bringing to the reviewers&rsquo; desk anything to be compared
with it in beauty of description, convincing characterization, absorbing plot and humorous
appeal. The freshness and sweet sincerity of the tale are most invigorating, and
that the book will be very much read there is no possible doubt.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Budget.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;The book will move to tears, provoke to laughter, stir the blood, and evoke heroisms
of history, making the reading of it a delight and the memory of it a stimulus and
a joy.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Evangelist.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="dropcap">L</span>ADS&rsquo; LOVE.</i> Illustrated.</p>

<p class="adblurb" style="clear:both;">&ldquo;It seems to us that there is in this latest product much of the realism of personal
experience. However modified and disguised, it is hardly possible to think that
the writer&rsquo;s personality does not present itself in Saunders McQuhirr.... Rarely has
the author drawn more truly from life than in the cases of Nance and &lsquo;the Hempie&rsquo;;
never more typical Scotsman of the humble sort than the farmer Peter Chrystie.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London
Athenæum.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="dropcap">C</span>LEG KELLY, ARAB OF THE CITY. His
Progress and Adventures.</i> Illustrated.</p>

<p class="adblurb" style="clear:both;">&ldquo;A masterpiece which Mark Twain himself has never rivaled.... If there ever was
an ideal character in fiction it is this heroic ragamuffin.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;In no one of his books does Mr. Crockett give us a brighter or more graphic
picture of contemporary Scotch life than in &lsquo;Cleg Kelly.&rsquo; ... It is one of the great
books.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Daily Advertiser.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="dropcap">B</span>OG-MYRTLE AND PEAT.</i> Third edition.</p>

<p class="adblurb" style="clear:both;">&ldquo;Here are idylls, epics, dramas of human life, written in words that thrill and
burn.... Each is a poem that has an immortal flavor. They are fragments of the
author&rsquo;s early dreams, too bright, too gorgeous, too full of the blood of rubies and the
life of diamonds to be caught and held palpitating in expression&rsquo;s grasp.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston
Courier.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;Hardly a sketch among them all that will not afford pleasure to the reader for
its genial humor, artistic local coloring, and admirable portrayal of character.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston
Home Journal.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE LILAC SUNBONNET.</i> Eighth edition.</p>

<p class="adblurb" style="clear:both;">&ldquo;A love story, pure and simple, one of the old fashioned, wholesome, sun-shiny
kind, with a pure-minded, sound-hearted hero, and a heroine who is merely a
good and beautiful woman; and if any other love story half so sweet has been written
this year it has escaped our notice.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p class="adblurb">&ldquo;The general conception of the story, the motive of which is the growth of love
between the young chief and heroine, is delineated with a sweetness and a freshness,
a naturalness and a certainty, which places &lsquo;The Lilac Sunbonnet&rsquo; among the best
stories of the time.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Mail and Express.</i></p>
